<div><span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span><h1>CHAPTER I<br/> <br/> KEATE’S WAY</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In the year 1809 George III appointed as Headmaster
of Eton, Dr. Keate, a terrible little man who
considered the flogging-block a necessary station on
the road to perfection, and who ended a sermon on
the Sixth Beatitude by saying, “Now, boys, be pure
in heart! For if not, I’ll flog you until you are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The county gentlemen and merchant princes who
put their sons under his care were not displeased
by such a specimen of pious ferocity, nor could they
think lightly of the man who had birched half the
ministers, bishops, generals, and dukes in the
kingdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In those days the severest discipline found favour
with the best people. The recent French Revolution
had proved the dangers of liberalism when it
affects the governing classes. Official England,
which was the soul of the Holy Alliance, believed
that in combating Napoleon she was combating
liberalism in the purple. She required from her
public schools a generation of smooth-tongued
hypocrites.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to crush out any possible republican
ardour in the young aristocrats of Eton, their
studies were organized on conventional and frivolous
lines. At the end of five years the pupil had
read Homer twice through, almost all Virgil, and
an expurgated Horace; he could turn out passable
Latin epigrams on Wellington and Nelson. The
taste for Latin quotations was then so pronounced,
that Pitt in the House of Commons being interrupted
in a quotation from the <span class='it'>Æneid</span>, the whole
House, Whigs and Tories alike, rose as one man to
supply the end. Certainly a fine example of
homogeneous culture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The study of science, being optional, was naturally
neglected, but dancing was obligatory. On the
subject of religion Keate held doubt to be a crime,
but that otherwise it wasn’t worth talking about.
He feared mysticism more than indifference, permitted
laughing in chapel and wasn’t strict about
keeping the Sabbath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, in order to make the reader understand
the—perhaps unconscious—Machiavellism of this
celebrated trainer of youth, we may note that he
did not mind being told a few lies: “A sign of
respect,” he would say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barbarous customs reigned amongst the boys
themselves. The little boys were the slaves or
“fags” of the big boys. The fag made his
master’s bed, fetched from the pump outside and
carried up his water in the morning, brushed his
clothes, and cleaned his shoes. Disobedience was
punished by torments to fit the crime. A boy writing
home, not to complain, but to describe his life,
says: “Rolls, whose fag I am, put on spurs to
force me to jump a ditch which was too wide for
me. Each time I funked it he dug them into me,
and of course my legs are bleeding, my ‘Greek
Poets’ reduced to pulp, and my new clothes torn
to tatters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The glorious “art of self-defence” was in high
honour. At the conclusion of one strenuous bout,
a boy was left dead upon the floor. Keate, coming
to look at the corpse, said simply: “This is
regrettable, of course, but I desire above all things
that an Eton boy should be ready to return a blow
for a blow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The real, but hidden, aim of the system was to
form “hard-faced men,” all run in the same mould.
In action you might be independent, but any
originality of thought, of dress, or of language, was
the most heinous of crimes. To betray the smallest
interest in ideas or books was a bit of disgusting
affectation to be forcibly pulled up by the roots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a life as this seemed to the majority of
English boys quite right. The pride they felt in
carrying on the traditions of a school like Eton
founded by a king, and under the protection of and
near neighbour to all the succeeding kings, was
balm of Gilead to their woes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only a few sensitive souls suffered terribly and
suffered long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of these, for example, the young Percy
Bysshe Shelley, son of a rich Sussex landowner,
and grandson to Sir Bysshe Shelley, Bart., did not
seem able to acclimatize himself at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This boy, who was exceptionally beautiful, with
brilliant blue eyes, dark curling hair, and a delicate
complexion, displayed a sensitiveness of conscience
most unusual in one of his class, as well as an
incredible tendency to question the Rules of the
Game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When first he appeared in the school, the Sixth
Form captains, seeing his slender build and
girlish air, imagined they would have little need
to enforce their authority over him. But they soon
discovered that the smallest threat threw him into
a passion of resistance. An unbreakable will, with
a lack of the necessary physical strength to carry
out its decrees, forefated him to rebellion. His
eyes, dreamy when at peace, acquired, under the
influence of enthusiasm or indignation, a light that
was almost wild; his voice, usually soft and low,
became agonized and shrill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His love of books, his contempt for games, his
long hair floating in the wind, his collar opened on
a girlish throat, everything about him scandalized
those self-charged to maintain in the little world of
Eton the brutal spirit of which it was so proud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Shelley, from his first day there, having
decided that fagging was an outrage to human
dignity, had refused obedience to the orders of his
fag-master, and in consequence was proclaimed an
outlaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was called “Mad Shelley.” The strongest
of his tormentors undertook to save his soul as by
fire, although they gave up attacking him in single
combat, when they found he would stop at nothing.
Scratching and slapping, he fought with open hands
like a girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An organized “Shelley-bait” became one of
the favourite amusements. Some scout would discover
the strange lad reading poetry by the riverside,
and at once give the “view hallo!” Shelley,
with his hair streaming on the wind, would take
flight across the meadows, through the college
cloisters, the Eton streets. Finally, surrounded like
a stag at bay, he would utter a prolonged and
piercing shriek, while his tormentors would “nail”
him to the wall with balls slimy with mud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A voice would cry “Shelley!” And “Shelley!”
another voice would take it up. The old
walls would re-echo to yells of “Shelley!” in
every key. A lickspittle fag would pluck at the
victim’s jacket; another would pinch him; a third
would kick away the books he squeezed convulsively
under his arm. Then, every finger
would be pointed towards him, while fresh cries of
“Shelley!” “Shelley!” “Shelley!” finally
shattered his nerves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crisis was reached for which his tormentors
waited—an outburst of mad rage, in which the
boy’s eyes flashed fire, his cheeks grew white, his
whole body trembled and shook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tired at length of a spectacle that was always
the same, the school went back to its games.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley picked up his mud-stained books and
lost in thought wandered away through the
meadows that border the Thames and, flinging
himself down on the sun-flecked grass, watched
the river glide past him. Running water, like
music, has the power to change misery into
melancholy. Both, through their smooth, unceasing
flow, pour over the soul the anodyne of forgetfulness
and peace. The massive towers of
Windsor and Eton, typified to the young rebel a
hostile and unchanging world, but the reflection
of the willow-trees trembling in the water soothed
him by its tenuous fragility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He returned to his books, to Diderot, to
Voltaire, to the system of M. d’Holbach. To
love these Frenchmen, so hated by his masters,
seemed an act of defiance worthy of his courage.
An English work condensed them all. Godwin’s
<span class='it'>Political Justice</span>. It was his favourite reading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Godwin made all things seem simple. Had men
studied him the world would have attained to a
state of idyllic happiness. Had they listened to
the voice of reason, that is of Godwin, two hours’
work a day would have been sufficient for all their
needs. Free love would have replaced the stupid
conventions of marriage, and philosophy have
banished the terrors of superstition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately, “prejudices” still shut men’s
minds to truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley closed his book, stretched himself out
upon the sunny, flower-starred grass, and meditated
on the misery of man. From the school
buildings behind him a confused murmur of
stupid voices floated out over the exquisite landscape
of wood and stream, but here at least no
mocking eye could spy upon him. The boy’s tears
ran down, and pressing his hands together, he
made this vow: “I swear, to be just and wise and
free, if such power in me lies. I swear never to
become an accomplice, even by my silence, of the
selfish and the powerful. I swear to dedicate my
whole life to the worship of beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had Dr. Keate been witness to the above outburst
of religious ardour, so deplorable in any
well-regulated school, he would certainly have
treated the case in his favourite way.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span><h1>CHAPTER II<br/> <br/> THE HOME</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In the holidays the refractory slave became the
hereditary prince. Mr. Timothy Shelley, his
father, owned the manor of Field Place in Sussex,
a well-built, low, white house surrounded by a
park, and extensive woods. There Shelley found
his four pretty sisters, a little brother three years
old, whom he had taught to say “The devil!” so
as to shock the pious, and his beautiful cousin
Harriet Grove, who people said resembled him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head of the family, Sir Bysshe Shelley,
lived in the market-town of Horsham. He was
a gentleman of the old school who boasted of
being as rich as a duke and of living like a
poacher. Six feet high, of commanding presence
and a handsome face, Sir Bysshe was of cynical
mind and energetic temperament. Unlike the
rest of the Shelleys, who all had bright blue eyes,
Sir Bysshe’s eyes were brown, inherited presumably
from his New Jersey mother, the wealthy
widow Plum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had sunk eighty thousand pounds in building
Castle Goring, but could not finish it because
of the expense. So he lived in a cottage close to
the Horsham Town Hall, with one man-servant as
eccentric as himself. He dressed like a peasant
and spent his days in the tap-room of the Swan
Inn, talking politics with all and sundry. He had
a rough sort of humour that frightened the slow-witted
country-folk. He had made his two
daughters so unhappy at home that they had run
away, which afforded him an excellent pretext for
not giving them any dowry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His one desire was to round off an immense
estate and to transmit it intact to innumerable
generations of Shelleys. With this in view he
had entailed the greater part of it on Percy, to
the total exclusion of his other children. Considering
his grandson as the necessary upholder
of his posthumous ambition, he had a certain
affection for him. But for his son, Timothy, who
dealt in stilted phrases, he had nothing but
contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timothy Shelley was member of Parliament for
the pocket borough of New Shoreham. Like his
father, he was tall and well made, fair, handsome
and imposing. He had a better heart than
Sir Bysshe but less will-power. Sir Bysshe was
rather attractive, as avowed egoists and cynics
often are. Timothy had good intentions and was
insupportable. He admired intellect with the
irritating want of tact of the illiterate. He affected
a fashionable respect for religion, an aggressive
tolerance for new ideas, a pompous philosophy.
He liked to call himself liberal in his political and
religious opinions, but was careful not to
scandalize the people of his set. A friend of the
Duke of Norfolk, he spoke with complacency of
the emancipation of the Irish Catholics. He was
proud of his own boldness and not a little scared
by it. He had tears at command, but became
ferocious if his vanity was touched. In private
life he plumed himself on his urbanity, but tried
to combine the mailed fist with the velvet glove.
Diplomatic in small things he was boorish in big
ones; inoffensive yet exasperating, he was well
fitted to try the temper of any young critic; and it
was the vexation caused by the silly bibble-babble
of his father which had done much to throw
Shelley into intellectual isolation. As to Mrs.
Shelley, she had been the prettiest girl in the
county, she liked a man to be a fighter and a
gentleman, and she would watch with disgust her
eldest son go off into the woods carrying a book
under his arm instead of a gun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the eyes of his sisters, however, Shelley was
a Superman. The moment he arrived from Eton
the house was filled with fantastic guests, the park
was alive with confused murmurs as in “A
Midsummer Night’s Dream.” The little girls
lived in a continual but agreeable terror. Percy
delighted in clothing with mystery the everyday
objects of life. There was no hole in the old walls
into which he did not thrust a stick in the search
for secret passages. In the attics he had discovered
a locked room. Here, said he, lived an
old alchemist with a long beard, the terrible
Cornelius Agrippa. When a noise was heard in
the attics, it was Cornelius upsetting his lamp.
During a whole week the Shelley family worked
in the garden, digging out a summer shelter for
Cornelius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other monsters woke again with the boy’s
arrival. There was the great tortoise which lived
in the pond, and the great old snake, a formidable
reptile, that once had really frequented the underwood,
and which one of the Squire’s gardeners had
killed with a scythe. “This gardener, little girls,
this gardener who had the look of a human being
like you and me, was in reality Father Time himself
who causes all legendary monsters to perish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What rendered these inventions so fascinating
was that the teller himself was not too sure he
was inventing them. Stories of witches and
ghosts had troubled his sensitive childhood. But
the more he feared ghostly apparitions the more
he forced himself to brave them. At Eton, having
drawn a circle on the ground, and set fire to
some alcohol in a saucer, which enveloped him in
its bluish flame, he began his incantation:
“Demons of the air, and of fire.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” “What
on earth are you doing, Shelley?” said his
Master, the solemn and magnificent Bethel,
interrupting him one day: “Please, sir, I’m
raising the devil.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” In the country likewise
the Lord of Darkness was often called up by a
shrill young voice, and sometimes to their great
joy the children received an order from the
sovereign brother to dress up as ghosts or
demons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The discipline of science was quite alien to
Shelley’s nature, but he liked its romantic side.
Armed with a machine which had just been
invented, he gave electric shocks to the admiring
bevy of little girls. But whenever little Hellen,
the youngest, saw him coming with a bottle and
a bit of wire she began to cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His dearest and most faithful disciples were
Elizabeth his eldest sister, and his lovely cousin,
Harriet Grove. These three children were drawn
together by their dawning senses and their impassioned
love of Truth. The first awakening of
instinct always sheds over ideas an extraordinary
charm. Shelley led his fair pupils to the churchyard
to which the mysterious presence of the dead
lent, in his eyes, a poetic fascination, and safe
from the pursuit of his father, seated between
them on some rustic tomb in the shadow of the
old church, arms round swaying waists, he discoursed
eloquently on all things in heaven and
earth while lovely eyes drank up his every word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The picture he drew of the world was a simple
one. On the one side Vice: kings, priests, and
the rich. On the other Virtue: philosophers, the
wretched, and the poor. Here, religion in the
service of tyranny: there, Godwin and his
<span class='it'>Political Justice</span>. But more often he spoke to the
girls of Love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men’s laws pretend to regulate our natural
sentiments. How absurd! When the eye perceives
a lovely being the heart takes fire. How is
it under man’s control to love or not to love? But
the essence of love is liberty and it withers in an
atmosphere of constraint. It is incompatible with
obedience, jealousy, or fear. It requires perfect
confidence and absolute freedom. Marriage is a
prison.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scepticism extended to marriage is a form of
wit which unmarried ladies do not much appreciate.
Metaphysical heresy may sometimes amuse
them, matrimonial heresy smells of the faggot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bonds?” repeated Harriet. “No doubt.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But what matter if the bonds are light
ones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they are light they are useless. Does one
shackle a voluntary prisoner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But religion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley called Holbach to the aid of Godwin.
“If God is just, how can we believe that he will
punish creatures whom he himself has created
weak? If he is All-Powerful, how is it possible
either to offend him or resist him? If he is
reasonable, why is he angry with the hapless
beings to whom he has left the liberty to be
unreasonable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Custom .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can custom matter to us in this short
moment of eternity which we call the nineteenth
century?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elizabeth took her brother’s side, and it was
impossible for Harriet to oppose a demi-god with
flashing eyes, a shirt-collar open on a delicate
throat, and hair as fine as spun-silk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sighed; then to change the conversation,
“Let us go on with <span class='it'>Zastrozzi</span>?” she proposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a novel which the three were writing
together. It dealt with a robber chief, a haughty
tyrant, and an “elegantly proportioned heroine
all tenderness and purity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hours passed pleasantly in <span class='it'>Zastrozzi’s</span> company;
the evening closed in. Elizabeth left the
guileless lovers alone in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley and Harriet, their arms interlocked,
wandered back to the house through the white
mist rising from the meadows. The breeze waved
the topmost leaves of the trees across the face
of the moon. The anemones shut their pale cups
and drooped their heads. The sadness of twilight
reminded Shelley of his approaching return to the
sombre cloisters of Eton. But conscious of the
warm loveliness of his cousin, who trembled and
vibrated beneath his touch, he felt himself filled
with new courage for a life of apostleship and
combat.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <br/> THE CONFIDANT</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In October, 1810, Timothy Shelley took his son up
to Oxford. The member for New Shoreham was
in the best of tempers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Objecting to hotels, he put up at his old
lodgings in the High—“the leaden horse”—appropriate
house-sign of John Slatter, Plumber
and Glazier. This Slatter was a son of Mr.
Shelley’s former landlord, whom he had succeeded
in the lodging-house and plumbing businesses.
Another son, with whom to his chagrin he was
to have much to do, had gone into partnership with
Munday, bookseller at Carfax.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Shelley had come to enter a future baronet
in the books of University College; through which
he himself had passed many years earlier, without
distinction. Such ceremonies are always agreeable
to an Englishman, and would be particularly
so to a man of the consequential turn of mind of
Timothy Shelley. So soon as the rite was satisfactorily
accomplished, he went down with Bysshe
to the bookseller, and there opened for him an
unlimited credit in books and paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son here,” he said, pointing good-humouredly
to the wild-haired youth with luminous
eyes who stood by, “has a literary turn, Mr.
Slatter. He is already the author of a romance”—it
was the famous <span class='it'>Zastrozzi</span>—“and if he wishes
to publish again, do pray indulge him in his printing
freaks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley was delighted with college. To have
rooms of his own, where he could sport his oak;
to be free to attend lectures or shirk them; to
follow the studies of his choice; to read, write, or
go walking as he pleased; this was to combine
the charm of the monastic life with the freedom
of thought of the philosopher. It was thus he had
dreamed of passing his life “for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening in hall he found himself seated by
the side of a young man, a freshman like himself,
who after introducing himself as “Jefferson
Hogg,” relapsed into the high-bred reserve which
Oxford manners require. However, towards the
middle of the meal the two young men, incapable
of maintaining silence any longer, began to talk of
their reading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The best poetical literature of these days,”
said Shelley, “is German literature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg, with a smile, asserted the German’s
want of nature. So much romanticism made him
tired.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What modern literature can you compare
with theirs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg named the Italian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This roused all Shelley’s impetuosity, and
started such an endless discussion that the servants
were able to clear the tables before the two
perceived they were alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come up to my rooms?” said Hogg.
“We can go on talking there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley eagerly accepted, but he lost the thread
of his discourse on the way and the whole of his enthusiasm
in the cause of Germany. While Hogg
was lighting the candles, his guest said calmly that
he was not qualified to maintain such a discussion,
being as ignorant of Italian as he was of German,
and that he had only talked for talking’s sake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg replied smiling that his own indifference
and ignorance were profound, and proceeded to
set out on the table a bottle, glasses, and biscuits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides,” declared Shelley, “all literature is
vain trifling. What is the study of ancient or
modern tongues but merely a study of words and
phrases, of the names of things? How much wiser
it were to investigate the things themselves!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How was this to be done, Hogg wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Through the physical sciences, and especially
through chemistry,” said Shelley, and raising his
voice he discoursed with a degree of animation
that far outshone his zeal in defence of the Germans,
on chemical analysis, on the recent discoveries
in physics, and on electricity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feeling no interest in these subjects Hogg had
leisure to examine the appearance of his new
friend. His clothes were expensive, and made
according to the most approved mode of the day,
but they were tumbled, rumpled, unbrushed. His
figure was slight and fragile, he was tall, but
appeared less tall than he really was, being round-shouldered,
through an habitual eagerness of mood
which always made him thrust his face forward.
His gestures were both graceful and abrupt, his
complexion red and white like a girl’s; his hair
dark-brown, long and bushy. His features
breathed an animation, a fire, a vivid and
preternatural intelligence. Nor was the moral
expression less beautiful than the intellectual, for
there was a softness, a delicacy, a gentleness
about it, and that air of profound religious veneration
which characterizes the frescoed saints of the
great masters of Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley was still talking when some clock
chimed—he uttered a cry. “My mineralogy
class!” and fled downstairs.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg had promised to call on him next morning.
He found him in a violent dispute with the
scout who wanted to tidy up his rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Books, boots, papers, pistols, linen, ammunition,
phials, and crucibles were scattered on the
floor and on every chair and table. An electrical
machine, an air pump, and a solar microscope
were conspicuous amidst the mass of matter.
Shelley turned the handle of the machine so that
the fierce crackling sparks flew out, and
presently getting upon the stool with glass feet,
his long wild locks bristled and stood on end.
Hogg, with a look of amusement, followed his
movements with anxiety, watching in particular
over the glasses and tea-cups. Just as his host
was going to pour out tea, the guest removed
in haste from the bottom of his cup a small gold
seven-shilling piece partly dissolved by the nitromuriatic
acid in which it was immersed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young men became inseparable. Every
morning they went for a long walk, during which
Shelley behaved like a child, climbing all the
banks, jumping all the ditches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he came to any water he launched paper
boats, and sent little argosies trembling down the
Isis. He followed them until they sank, while
Hogg, compliant but exasperated, waited for him
at the starting point by the water’s edge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the walk they went up to Shelley’s rooms
where, worn out by his continual expenditure of
energy, he would be overcome by extreme drowsiness.
He would lie stretched out upon the rug
before a large fire and, curled round upon himself
like a cat, would sleep thus from six to ten. At
ten he would suddenly start up, and rubbing his
eyes with great violence and passing his fingers
swiftly through his long hair, he would enter at
once into a vehement argument, or begin to recite
verses with an energy which was almost painful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At eleven he supped, but his meals were very
simple. Eating no meat on principle, he liked
bread, and his pockets were always full of it. He
would walk reading and nibbling as he went, and
his path was marked by a long line of crumbs.
Next to bread he liked pudding raisins and dried
prunes bought at the grocer’s. A regular sit-down
meal was intolerably boring to him, and he
hardly ever remained to the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After supper his mind was clear and his conversation
brilliant. He spoke to Hogg about
his cousin Harriet, to whom he wrote long letters
in which outbursts of love alternated with Godwin’s
philosophy; about his sister Elizabeth, a
valiant enemy of convention. Or he read the last
solemn letter from his father with shrieks of
laughter. Or he took up one of his favourite
books, Locke, Hume or Voltaire, and commented
on it with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg often asked himself why these writers
exercised so great a fascination over the religious
and mystical nature of his friend. It seemed as
though in suddenly discovering in the by-ways of
his extensive reading the immense variety of
systems, resembling an entanglement of deep
valleys and rocky precipices, that a sort of vertigo
must have seized Shelley and only a clear and
simple doctrine such as Godwin’s could relieve
his metaphysical giddiness. He amused himself
by substituting for the titanic and confused
accumulations of History, an aëry edifice of
crystalline theories, and he preferred to the real
world, the incoherence of which terrified him, the
more agreeable vision which the soul gains by
looking at facts through the vaporous meshes of
clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the college clock struck two. Hogg got
up, and in spite of the protestations of his friend
went off to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an extraordinary creature!” thought
he as he went up to his room .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “the grace
of a young girl, the purity of a maiden who has
never left her mother’s side .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and nevertheless
an indomitable force .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the soul of a
Benedictine monk, with the ideas of a Jacobin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was certainly a strange mixture, well worth
thinking over. But Master Jefferson Hogg didn’t
care about tiring his brain, and his dear friend
Shelley always gave him an overwhelming desire
to sleep.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <br/> THE NEIGHBOURING PINE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A few days before Christmas Mr. Shelley
found in his letter-bag a communication from a
London publisher, a certain Mr. Stockdale, who
called his attention to the extraordinary productions
which young Mr. Percy Shelley desired to
have published. Stockdale had received the MS.
of a novel, <span class='it'>St. Irvyne, or the Rosicrucian</span>, filled
with the most subversive ideas, and the worthy
tradesman could not see without misgiving the son
of so estimable a gentleman as Mr. Shelley treading
this dangerous path. He considered it to be
his duty to warn the young man’s father; and
above all to call his attention to the young man’s
evil genius, his comrade Mr. Jefferson Hogg, son
of a good old Tory family in the north of
England, but thoroughly false and dangerous in
character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Shelley replied by informing Stockdale that
he refused to pay one penny of the printing bill,
which greatly increased the metaphysical and
doctrinal anxieties of the publisher. Then, while
awaiting the arrival of his son, who was to spend
the first week of the Christmas holidays at Field
Place, he prepared one of his incoherent,
affectionate, and blustering sermons, in the bombastic
style of which he was past master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arguments have never convinced anybody yet.
But to imagine that the arguments of a father can
change the ideas of a son is the height of
argumentative madness. At the close of the conversation
Shelley went away sickened by the
stupidity of his family, filled with a righteous fury
at the behaviour of Stockdale so unworthy of a
gentleman, and more than ever attached to
Jefferson Hogg, his only friend. That very
evening he sat down and confided every thing to
him in a long letter:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody attacks me for my detestable principles;
I am reckoned an outcast; there lowers a
terrific tempest, but I stand as it were on a pharos,
and smile exultingly at the vain beating of the
billows below. I attempted to enlighten my father.
<span class='it'>Mirabile dictu!</span> He, for a time, listened to my
arguments; he allowed the impossibility of any
direct intervention of Providence. He allowed the
utter incredibility of witches, ghosts, legendary
miracles. But when I came to <span class='it'>apply</span> the truths on
which we had agreed so harmoniously, he started
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and silenced me with an equine argument ‘I
believe because I believe.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother believes me to be in the high-road
to Pandemonium. She fancies I want to make a
deistical coterie of all my little sisters. How
laughable!”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Field Place, usually so gay during the holidays,
was overshadowed by these happenings. Mrs.
Shelley advised her daughters not to speak too
much with Percy, and the little girls became shy
and silent. They continued their Christmas preparations
through force of habit, but no one took
any further interest in them; the little amusements
and surprises were arranged as usual, but without
the laughter and fun which makes Christmas Day
so delightful in happy families.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only Elizabeth remained faithful to Shelley in
secret. But she saw that her admiration was no
longer shared by her cousin Harriet, who grew
colder and more evasive every day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letters which Harriet had received from
Oxford, filled with enthusiastic dissertations
extremely difficult to follow, had troubled and
annoyed her. The quotations from Godwin bored
her to tears, and her terror was even greater than
her boredom. It is rare that pretty women show a
taste for dangerous ideas. Beauty, the natural
expression of law and order, is conservative by
essence; it upholds all established religions of
which it adorns the ceremonies; Venus was always
the right hand of Jupiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet showed Shelley’s letters to her mother,
who advised her to pass them on to her father.
This gentleman pronounced Shelley’s doctrines to
be abominable. Both parents took gloomy views
as to the young man’s future. Ought Harriet to
unite herself with an eccentric creature whose
follies alienated everybody? She loved elegance,
county balls, and admiration. What sort of a life
would she lead with this mad boy who respected
nothing, not even marriage? Yet, after all,
religion has claims.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Shelley’s arrival the two young girls had
some violent discussions. Elizabeth pleaded his
cause. How could Harriet weigh a few poor
worldly successes against the happiness of passing
her life with the most marvellous of men?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You make your brother out to be an extraordinary
person, but how can I be sure he really
is as you represent him? We have always lived in
the country, we know nothing of life. Our
parents, your own father even, who is in Parliament,
disapprove of Bysshe’s ideas. However, let
us admit that he is a genius. What right have <span class='it'>I</span>
to enter into an intimacy with him which must end
in disappointment when he discovers how really
inferior I am to the being his imagination has pictured?
I am just an ordinary young girl like all
the rest. He has idealized me and he would be
very much surprised if he knew me as I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much modesty gives one to think: Love does
not reason like this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Shelley arrived Elizabeth explained the
situation to him. Instantly he sought Harriet
out. He found her cold and distant, exactly as
Elizabeth had described her. She did not ask
Shelley to justify himself: all she asked was that
he should leave her alone. She reproached him
with his universal scepticism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But really, Harriet,” Shelley protested, “it
is monstrous that I should not be allowed to
express opinions which I have reached by the most
logical of arguments. And how can my
theological opinions disqualify me as brother,
friend, or lover?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may think what you please,” replied
Harriet, “I do not care in the least what you
think, but don’t ask me to unite my lot with
yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time Shelley had come in contact
with a woman’s indifference, which she can
spring upon a man with the suddenness of night
falling in the centre of Africa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went away mad with grief. Through the
naked, frozen woods, he wandered back towards
Field Place; unconscious of the drifting snow, he
paced for hours the village graveyard, which had
been the background for love’s young dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got home at two o’clock in the morning,
and went to bed after placing a loaded pistol, and
various poisons taken from his chemical arsenal,
by his side. But the thought of Elizabeth’s grief
on finding his corpse prevented him from killing
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day he wrote to Hogg. Against Harriet
herself he expressed no resentment, none against
his father nor Mr. Grove. The Spirit of Intolerance
alone was responsible for the tragedy:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Here I swear—and as I break my oaths,
may Infinity, Eternity blast me—I swear that I
will never forgive Intolerance! It is the only
point on which I allow myself to encourage
revenge; every moment I can spare shall be
devoted to my object. Intolerance is of the
greatest disservice to Society; it encourages prejudices
which strike at the root of the dearest, the
tenderest of its ties. Oh how I wish I were the
avenger!—that it were mine to crush the demon;
to hurl him to his native hell, never to rise again
and thus to establish for ever perfect and universal
toleration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect to gratify some of this insatiable feeling
in poetry. You shall see, you shall hear, how
it has injured me. <span class='it'>She</span> is no longer mine! <span class='it'>She</span>
abhors me as a sceptic, as what <span class='it'>she</span> was before!
O bigotry! When I pardon this last, this
severest of thy persecutions, may Heaven—if there
be wrath in Heaven—blast me!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, I have done. I am afraid there
is selfishness in the passion of love, for I cannot
avoid feeling every instant as if my soul were
bursting. But I <span class='it'>will</span> feel no more. It is selfish.
I would feel for others, but for myself—oh how
much rather would I expire in the struggle!
Yes, that were a relief! Is suicide wrong? I
slept with a loaded pistol and some poison last
night, but did not die. Had it not been for my
sister, for <span class='it'>you</span>, I should have bidden you a final
farewell.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There still remained a fortnight of the holidays
to be passed at Field Place, an unhappy fortnight
owing to the displeasure of his father and mother,
and the embarrassment of his sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of Elizabeth’s invitations Harriet
refused to come over and see them while he was
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>People began to whisper, under the seal of
secrecy, that she was engaged to someone else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeking to appease his spirit in the endeavour
to make others happy, Shelley had resolved that
Hogg should fall in love with Elizabeth, whom
he had never seen. He sent Hogg some verses
written by her, which were filled with good intentions,
hatred of tyranny, and faults of prosody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All are brethren,” sang Elizabeth like the
good pupil she was, “even the African bending
to the stroke of the hard-hearted Englishman’s
rod” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and more in the same strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In return, Shelley gave his sister Hogg’s poems
which he declared to be “extremely beautiful”
and in which he himself was compared to a young
oak, and Harriet Grove to the ivy which stifles the
tree by its embraces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have not said,” wrote Shelley, “that the
ivy after it had destroyed the oak, as if to mock
the miseries which it had caused, twined around
a pine which stood near.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The neighbouring pine was Mr. Heylar, a
wealthy landowner, and a man of sound doctrines,
who had been expressly created by Providence
to escort his wife to county balls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is lost to me for ever! She is married!
Married to a clod of earth! She will become as
insensible herself. All those fine capabilities will
moulder. Let us speak no more on the subject.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have liked to invite Hogg to Field
Place, so that Elizabeth might judge for herself of
his admirable qualities. But the squire, remembering
Stockdale’s warnings concerning a certain
Evil Genius, forbade the invitation.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <br/> QUOD ERAT DEMONSTRANDUM</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>About a month after these unfortunate holidays,
Messrs. Munday &amp; Slatter, the Oxford booksellers
to whom Timothy Shelley had recommended the
literary freaks of his son, saw that young man
burst into their shop, his hair flying, his shirt-collar
wide open, and a fat parcel of pamphlets
under his arm. He wished these to be sold at
sixpence each, and to be displayed conspicuously
in the shop-window. To be sure of this being well
done, he set about doing it himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The booksellers watched him at work with the
amused and fatherly benevolence which Oxford
tradesmen show to Oxford freshmen who have
plenty of money. Had they looked closer they
would have been horrified at the explosive matter
with which their young customer strewed their
counters and windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The title of the pamphlet, <span class='it'>The Necessity of
Atheism</span>, was the most scandalous imaginable in a
mealy-mouthed, theological city like Oxford. It
was signed by the unknown name of “Jeremiah
Stukeley,” and had Messrs. Munday &amp; Slatter
turned over its pages they would have been more
horrified still by the insolent logic of the
imaginary Stukeley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A close examination of the validity of the
proofs adduced to support any proposition, has
ever been allowed to be the only sure way of
attaining truth, upon the advantages of which it
is unnecessary to descant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with this bold axiom that the pamphlet
began, and written in the form of a geometrical
theorem it proceeded to prove the impossibility of
the existence of God. It ended triumphantly with
the three letters Q.E.D., <span class='it'>quod erat demonstrandum</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Shelley who knew nothing of mathematics,
this formula had always seemed like a magician’s
spell for the evocation of Truth. Although he had
an ardent belief in a Spirit of universal Goodness,
the creator and director of all things; although he
professed the personal theology of an anglican
“<span class='it'>Vicaire Savoyard</span>”; the word “Atheist”
pleased him because of its vigour. He loved to
fling it in the face of Bigotry. He picked up the
epithet with which he had already been pelted at
Eton, as a Knight Errant picks up a glove. To
the physical and moral courage of his race, he
added intellectual courage, thus affronting great
dangers and an inevitable scandal.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Necessity of Atheism</span> had been published
just twenty minutes, when the Rev. John Walker,
a Fellow of New College, a man of a sinister and
inquisitorial turn of mind, passed the shop-window
and looked in.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Necessity of Atheism!</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Astounded
and outraged, the Rev. John strode into the shop,
calling out in stentorian tones, “Mr. Munday!
Mr. Slatter! What is the meaning of this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, sir, we know nothing about it. We
have not personally examined the pamphlet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>The Necessity of Atheism!</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But the title
in itself is sufficient to inform you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so, sir. Quite so. And now that our
attention has been called to it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that your attention, gentlemen, has been
called to it, you will have the goodness to withdraw
immediately every copy from your window,
and to carry them, as well as any other copies you
may possess, into your kitchen and throw them all
into the fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Walker had not, of course, the smallest
right to give any such order, but the booksellers
knew that he had only to complain to the University
authorities, and they would see their shop put
out of bounds. So they obeyed with obsequious
smiles, and sent one of their clerks to beg young
Mr. Shelley to step round for a few minutes’ conversation
with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are very sorry, Mr. Shelley, very sorry
indeed, but really we couldn’t help ourselves.
Mr. Walker insisted on it, and in your own
interest .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his “own interest” was the last thing
Shelley ever thought of. In his piercing, urgent
voice, he asserted to the much-worried booksellers
his right to think as he pleased, and to
communicate his thoughts to the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” he told them triumphantly, “I have
done worse than spread my net in the sight of
callow Oxford birds. I have sent a copy of <span class='it'>The
Necessity of Atheism</span> to every bishop on the
Bench, to the Chancellor of the University, and
to every college Master, Warden, and Dean, with
the compliments of ‘Jeremiah Stukeley’ in my
own handwriting!”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days later a porter appeared in Hogg’s
rooms with the Dean’s compliments to Mr. Shelley,
and would he go down to him immediately. He
went down to the Common Room where he found
the Master and several of the Fellows; a little
group of learned puritans, all classical and
muscular Christians who had always abhorred
Shelley because of his long hair, his eccentricities
of dress, and his really low taste for experimental
science.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dean showed him a copy of <span class='it'>The Necessity
of Atheism</span>, and asked him if he were the author.
As he spoke in a rude, abrupt, and insolent voice,
Shelley did not reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you, yes or no, the author of this
pamphlet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you can prove that it is by me, produce
your evidence. It is neither just nor lawful to
interrogate me in this fashion. Such proceedings
would become a court of inquisitors, but not free
men in a free country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you choose to deny that this is your composition?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I refuse to reply.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you are expelled, and I desire that you
will quit the college to-morrow morning at the
very latest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An envelope sealed with the college seal was
immediately handed to him by one of the Fellows.
It contained the sentence of expulsion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley dashed back to Hogg’s rooms, flung
himself down on the sofa, and trembling with
rage repeated “Expelled! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Expelled!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The punishment was terrible. It put a stop to
his studies; made it impossible for him to enter
any other university; deprived him of the peaceful
life he so much enjoyed; and drew down on his
head his father’s grotesque and inextinguishable
anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg was as indignant as his friend, and carried
away by a youthful generosity, instantly addressed
a note to the Master and Fellows, expressing his
grief and astonishment that such treatment could
have been meted out to such a man as Shelley.
He trusted that the sentence was not final.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The note was dispatched. The Conclave was
still sitting. In a moment the porter returned with
“the Dean’s compliments to Mr. Hogg and would
he go down at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The audience was brief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you write this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the letter he had just written and he
acknowledged it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this?” putting into Hogg’s hand the
pamphlet on Atheism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a wealth of arguments and the subtleties
of a K.C., Hogg pointed out the absurdity of the
question, and the injustice of punishing Shelley for
having refused to answer it, the obligation lying
on every man conscious of his rights.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s enough!” shouted the Master in a
furious voice. “You’re expelled too!” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
He seemed in a mood to have expelled every man
in the college. Hogg was handed the sealed
envelope in his turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of the day a large official paper
was affixed to the door of hall. It was signed
by the Master and Dean, bore the college seal, and
declared that Thomas Jefferson Hogg and Percy
Bysshe Shelley were publicly expelled for refusing
to answer certain questions put to them.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <br/> TIMOTHY SHELLEY’S VIGOROUS DIALECTICS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The exiles set off bag and baggage in the Oxford
coach. Shelley had borrowed £20 from his booksellers,
in order to pay his way in London while
waiting news from his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every lodging which he visited with Hogg
appeared to him impossible, either the street was
too noisy, the district too dirty, the maid-servant
too plain. Finally, the name of Poland Street
reminded him of Warsaw .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of Freedom .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
he was certain that in Poland Street any one of
the rooms must be worthy of a free man’s choice,
and the very first which he visited, where there
was a trellised paper, vine leaves, and huge
bunches of green and purple grapes, seemed to
him the most beautiful room in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here we will settle down,” said he, “and
begin our Oxford days over again, our readings
by the fireside, our rambles, our delightful experiences.
Here we will live for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing was wanting to his programme but
the consent of the two fathers, Mr. Shelley and
Mr. Hogg.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Timothy Shelley heard of the events at
Oxford, he was enraged beyond measure. Evidently,
for a wealthy landowner, a Member of
Parliament, and a J.P. for his county, it was a
most disagreeable occurrence. The accusation of
atheism annoyed him most, because he himself was
known as a Liberal, and such advanced thought in
politics required to balance it orthodoxy in
religion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down and wrote a solemn letter to Mr.
Hogg senior, deploring “the unfortunate affair
that has happened to my son and yours at
Oxford,” and urging him to get his “young man
home” as soon as possible. “As for me,” he
added, “I shall recommend mine to read Paley’s
<span class='it'>Natural Theology</span>: it is extremely applicable. I
shall read it with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he wrote a second letter to his own
“young man,” very strongly worded: “Though
I have felt as a father and sympathized in the misfortune
which your criminal opinions and improper
acts have begot: yet you must know that I have
a duty to perform to my own character, as well
as to your young brother and sisters. Above all
my feelings as a Christian require from me a firm
and decided conduct toward you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you shall require aid or assistance from
me—or any protection—you must please yourself
to me:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“1st. To go immediately to Field Place, and
to abstain from all communication with Mr. Hogg
for some considerable time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“2nd. That you shall place yourself under
the care and society of such gentleman as I shall
appoint and attend to his instructions and directions
he shall give.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If these conditions were not accepted Timothy
Shelley would abandon his son to all the misery
which such wicked and diabolical opinions justly
entail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley’s reply was brief:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Father</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you do me the honour of requesting to
hear the determination of my mind as the basis of
your future actions I feel it my duty, although it
gives me pain to wound ‘the sense of duty to
your own character, to that of your family and
your feelings as a Christian,’ decidedly to refuse
my assent to both the proposals in your letter and
to affirm that similar refusals will always be the
fate of similar requests. With many thanks for
your great kindness,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remain your affectionate, dutiful son,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“<span class='sc'>Percy B. Shelley</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chief obstacle in the diplomatic relations
between father and son is that the former desires
above all things to avoid a rupture, which renders
disciplinary measures difficult. His “conditions”
having been succinctly refused, Timothy Shelley
found himself at a loss what to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a bad man at bottom, he believed in the
powerful persuasion of a bottle of old port. He
resolved to go up to town and invite the delinquents
to dinner at Miller’s Hotel, where the wine
was good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all,” he said to himself, while waiting
for the two young men, “one must treat young
people with good humour, and even go so far,
ridiculous as it may seem, as to discuss things
with them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A ripened and thoughtful mind
should get the better, without any difficulty, of a
philosopher of eighteen, and serious misfortune
may be avoided, by a word of wisdom in the nick
of time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I mustn’t forget that Percy is my
heir and that he will succeed to the title: he must
be led back into the fold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the excellent man, while marshalling into
order Paley’s chief arguments, rubbed his hands
with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, the friends, going on foot from
Poland Street to Southwark, read aloud to each
other passages from Voltaire’s <span class='it'>Philosophical Dictionary</span>
which Shelley had picked up on a stall.
They found it extremely amusing and laughed
immoderately at the old Frenchman’s ridicule of
the Jewish people, the intolerance with which the
Bible is packed, and Jehovah’s sickening and useless
cruelties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they reached the hotel, a certain Mr.
Graham, the factotum of Timothy Shelley, was
already there with his friend and patron. Mr.
Shelley received Hogg with a wheedling benevolence,
then turning to his son, began to talk in
an odd, unconnected manner, punctuating his discourse
with dramatic gestures, which appeared
highly ridiculous to the two young men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of my father?” Shelley
whispered to Hogg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it is not your father. It is the God of
the Jews, the Jehovah you have been reading
about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Percy gave a wild demoniacal burst of laughter,
slipped from his seat and fell on his back at full
length on the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, Bysshe? Are you ill?
Are you mad? Why do you laugh?” asked his
father, scandalized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately, at the same moment, dinner was
announced, and proving excellent, the conversation
became almost cordial. When the dessert was put
on the table, the squire sent his son off to order the
post-horses for the next morning, while he undertook
the conquest of Hogg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a very different person, sir, from
what I expected to find; you are a nice, moderate,
reasonable, pleasant gentleman. Tell me what
you think I ought to do with my poor boy? He
is rather wild, is he not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, rather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what am I to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he had married his cousin he would perhaps
have been less so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He wants somebody to
take care of him; a good wife. What if he were
married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how can I do that? It is impossible. If
I were to tell Bysshe to marry a girl he would
refuse immediately. I know him so well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no doubt he would refuse if you were
to order him to marry, and I should not blame
him. But if you were to bring him in contact with
some young lady who you believed would make
him a suitable wife, without saying anything about
marriage, perhaps he would take a fancy to her,
and if he did not like her you could try another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Graham, interposing, said it was an excellent
plan, and the two men talking in low voices
were going over a list of the young women of
their acquaintance, when Shelley returned. His
father ordered a bottle of a still older port than
any they had yet had, and began to speak in praise
of himself. He was so highly respected in the
House of Commons: he was respected by the
whole House and by the Speaker in particular,
who said to him, “Mr. Shelley, I do not know
what we should do without you.” He was
greatly beloved in the county; he was an admirable
Justice of the Peace; he told a very long story of
how he had lately committed two poachers:
“You know the fellows, Graham. You know
what they are?” Graham assented. “Well,
when they got out of prison one of them came
and thanked me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why the poacher was so grateful for a pitiless
sentence Hogg never knew, for the worthy
magistrate, believing the wine to have by now produced
its effect, attacked the principal subject of
his thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is certainly a God,” said he. “There
can be no doubt of the existence of a Deity; none
whatever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nobody present expressed any doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, sir,” said he, addressing himself to
Hogg, “you have no doubt on the subject, have
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None whatever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you have, I can prove it to you in a
moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have no doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. still you might perhaps like to hear
my argument?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will read it to you then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He searched in all his pockets, pulling out
various bills and letters, producing finally a half-sheet
of note-paper, which he began to read.
Bysshe, leaning forward, listened with profound
attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard this argument before,” said he,
at the end of a few minutes, and turning to Hogg,
“Where have I heard that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are Paley’s arguments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” the reader observed with much complacency.
“They are Paley’s arguments. I
copied them out of Paley’s book this morning, but
Paley had them originally from me; everything in
Paley’s book he had from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this he folded up the paper, and returned it
to his pocket. His son watched him with more
disdain than ever, and the dinner terminated without
having brought about a reconciliation.
Shelley refused to go with his father. His father
refused to give him a penny. The only two who
seemed satisfied with one another were Hogg and
his host. Timothy Shelley had found his son’s
friend to be far more human than his son. He
was not like Percy, always with bristling quills,
always on the strain, always dug in behind principles
which one could not attack without wounding
his infernal pride. Young as he was, Hogg
understood life. His notions on marriage were
sensible. Hogg, on his side, declared that
though the oratorical eloquence of the member for
New Shoreham was certainly a bit foggy, nevertheless
he was very hospitable and a good sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days later he gave another proof that he
understood life by making up his quarrel with his
own father, who, head of a True Blue Tory family,
well known for its orthodoxy, had no need to display
the same horror at the actions of his
“young man” as had the Whig owner of Field
Place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg senior advised his son to read for the Bar
and got him into a conveyancer’s chambers at
York. Hogg was, therefore, obliged to abandon
Shelley in the Poland Street lodgings, a wistful,
bright-eyed fox in the midst of the green and
purple bunches of grapes.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <br/> AN ACADEMY FOR YOUNG LADIES</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Alone in London, without friends, work, or
money, Shelley fell into despair. He passed his
time in writing melancholy poems, or letters to
Hogg. Not knowing what to do with his evenings
he went to bed at eight o’clock. Sleep alone
stopped him from going over and over the story
of his woes. The moment he let himself think, the
image of his beautiful and shallow-hearted cousin
rose to torture him. He tried to steel his heart
against the painful vision by syllogisms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I loved a being,” he told himself. “The
being whom I loved is not what she was: consequently,
as love appertains to mind and not to
body, she exists no longer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I might as well
court the worms, which the soulless body of a
beloved being generates in the damp unintelligent
vaults of a charnel-house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This appeared to him such excellent logic that
he was astounded it brought him no consolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The money question grew serious. His father
gave no sign of life. Shelley meeting him one
day by chance, politely hoped he was well? All he
got was a look black as a thunder cloud and a
majestic “Your most humble servant, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately, his sisters did not forget him and
sent him their pocket-money. It was all he had
to live on. Elizabeth at Field Place was too well
watched to do anything, but the younger girls
were now at Mrs. Fenning’s Academy for Young
Ladies on Clapham Common, and very soon Mrs.
Fenning’s pupils made acquaintance with the fine
eyes, the open shirt-collar and tossed curls of
Hellen Shelley’s wonderful brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would arrive, his pockets bulging with biscuits
and raisins, and begin to discourse on
ultimate themes to an adoring circle of little girls.
He had undertaken to “illuminate” the prettiest
amongst them. He could not endure the idea that
so much loveliness should be abandoned to
“prejudices.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He admired most of all his sisters’ greatest
friend, Harriet Westbrook, a lovely child of
sixteen, with light brown hair and a complexion
of milk and roses. She was small, slightly and
delicately formed, and had an air of youthful
gaiety, of delicious freshness. She came to the
rescue when Mrs. Fenning, acting on the orders of
Timothy Shelley, requested Percy to visit his
sisters less often. Harriet, whose family lived in
Chapel Street, Mayfair, often went home: the
little sisters, therefore, entrusted her with the
cakes and the money intended for Percy, and she
taking these to the hermit of Poland Street, the
two young people became naturally the greatest
friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet Westbrook’s father was a retired
publican; he had made money, and desired to give
his youngest daughter a genteel education. Her
mother was dead, and she had been brought up
by Eliza, a much older sister. One can easily
imagine the interest which the Westbrook family
took in the grandson of a baronet, the heir to an
immense fortune, who was beautiful as a young
god, lived in lodgings on bread and pudding
raisins, and to whom the youngest of the Westbrook
girls carried his sisters’ pocket-money to
prevent him from starving to death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliza being keen to see the hero, Harriet took
her with her on the next visit. Shelley was somewhat
intimidated by the elder Miss Westbrook, a
mature virgin, dried-up and bony, with a dead-white
skin seamed with scars, and fish-like eyes
that stared without intelligence, the whole crowned
with an immense crop of black hair. Eliza was
particularly proud of her hair. Her affected
manners were in striking contrast with Harriet’s
spontaneous gaiety. But Bysshe soon forgot she
was plain when he saw that her intentions were
friendly. Not only she made no objection, as
might have been feared, to Harriet’s visits to
Poland Street, but she offered to bring her there,
and on several occasions invited Shelley to come
and dine with them when Mr. Westbrook was
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She completely won the heart of the young
philosopher by asking to share with Harriet in
his teaching, and undertook to read the <span class='it'>Philosophical
Dictionary</span> under his guidance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet’s walks with Shelley soon became the
talk of the Young Ladies’ Academy. One of the
mistresses thought fit to warn her: “Young Mr.
Shelley is notorious for his advanced opinions, and
it is probable that his morals are no better than
his ideas.” Harriet had to give up a letter from
him, filled with the most pernicious arguments,
and for corresponding with an “atheist,” she was
threatened with expulsion. The county gentlemen’s
daughters gave the cold shoulder to the
publican’s daughter, and life in the school was
made exceeding bitter to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One night as Shelley sat alone, reading by his
fireside, a message was brought him from Eliza
to say that Harriet was sick, and would he come
and keep her company. He found her in bed,
very pale, but lovelier than ever, with all her
chestnut hair spread about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Westbrook came upstairs to say “How-d’ye-do,”
and Shelley was rather embarrassed on
seeing him, for however free he was from convention,
he could not help feeling that his presence
at that late hour in a young girl’s bedroom was
hardly discreet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Westbrook, however, showed himself all
geniality. “Sorry I can’t stop with you but
I’ve got friends downstairs. Perhaps you’ll join
us presently?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley thanked him and declined. The
friends of Westbrook had no attraction for him.
He sat beside Harriet’s bed, with Eliza near by.
She was in eloquent vein, speaking at great
length on the enthralling subject of Love. Harriet
complained of a headache; she could not stand
the noise of conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well then,” said Eliza, “I’ll go away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two young things were left alone until long
after midnight, while Westbrook’s friends drank
and roared below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day Harriet was quite well.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley’s exile was less hard to bear from the
moment he could receive the visits of a young
girl and “illuminate” her soul. Nevertheless, he
suffered from being separated from his sister
Elizabeth. She no longer even answered his
letters. Could she be shut up in her room? He
determined at all costs to make a secret visit to
Field Place so as to see her. At times he thought
of a pacific invasion. What could happen to him,
after all, if one evening he turned up there without
notice, and opposed a Quaker-like silence to
the cursings of his father? But the adventure
was simplified when Captain Pilfold, a brother of
Mrs. Shelley, offered his nephew most opportunely
a jumping-off place for his attack on Field Place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pilfold was a hearty and jovial old sea-dog who,
under Nelson, had commanded a frigate at
Trafalgar. He infinitely preferred his fantastic
nephew to his solemn brother-in-law. That Percy
were an atheist or not, the Captain did not care
a hang. The boy had energy, and that was the
important thing. He invited him to run down to
Cuckfield, ten miles from Field Place, and received
him with open arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley, out of gratitude, offered to “illuminate”
his host, and the Captain proved such an
apt scholar that at the end of ten days he
staggered the Rector and the Doctor by his fiery
syllogisms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Cuckfield, Shelley made acquaintance with
Miss Kitchener, a school-teacher, from the
neighbouring town of Hurstpierpoint. She was
rather good-looking, had a Roman nose, and was
in her twenty-ninth year. She was a republican
in politics, and enjoyed the reputation of being
sentimental and conceited. She, on her side,
lamented that there was not one who understood
her. Shelley having admired as was natural to him
the nobility of her attitude, perceived with regret
that she was still a deist. He proposed “a
polemical correspondence,” in the course of which
he undertook to cure her of this infirmity. She
agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Pilfold, meanwhile, set off courageously
to grapple and board Timothy Shelley. He had
the bright idea of enrolling in the cause the Duke
of Norfolk, chief of the Whig party. Snobbism
triumphed over paternal tyranny. Shelley walked
back into Field Place with all the honours of war.
He was given £200 a year unconditionally.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could now again see Elizabeth, but he was
overwhelmed by the change he found in her. She
was livelier, and gayer, than formerly, but had
become incredibly frivolous. He remembered her
serious, enthusiastic; he found her apathetic to
everything but dancing, trivial amusements, and
silly chatter. She lived now for nothing but
society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wished to read to her Hogg’s letters as he
had been used to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you and your ridiculous friend! Every
one I know thinks you are both mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this she spoke of matrimony: she thought
of little else, and nothing disgusted Shelley more.
She seemed to have forgotten all they had read
together on the subject, and all Godwin’s elevated
ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marriage is odious and hateful,” he told her.
“I am sickened when I think of this despotic
chain, the heaviest forged by man to shackle fiery
souls. Scepticism and free love are as necessarily
associated together as religion and marriage.
Honourable men have no need of laws. For
heaven’s sake, Elizabeth, read over the Marriage
Service and ask yourself if any decent man could
wish the girl he loved to submit to such
degradation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet you want me to marry your friend
Hogg?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but not by a clergyman nor according
to man’s laws, but freely and with Love only as
high priest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This then is the honourable advice of a
brother?” said Elizabeth with disdain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was useless to hope to make any impression
on a character become futile beyond any possible
cure. “Why should I deceive myself? She is
lost, lost to everything. She talks nothing but
cant and twaddle. What she wants of me is that,
like a fashionable brother, I should act as a jackal
for husbands, well, I refuse! I refuse
emphatically.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had returned to Field Place merely to see
Elizabeth. There was no good in remaining.
Invitations elsewhere were not wanting. Captain
Pilfold would have been glad to have him again
at Cuckfield. Westbrook was going to pass the
summer in Wales, and his daughters pressed
Shelley to join them. Hogg wanted him to come
for a month to York; it was this last idea which
tempted him most. But his father, who doubtless
saw a symbolic value in the separation of
the two Oxford criminals, would not have tolerated
it, and as the first quarter’s allowance was
due on the first of September it was better to be
patient. Hogg wrote jestingly that it was easy to
see the lovely Harriet took precedence over old
friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your jokes amuse me,” Shelley answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I know anything about love I am <span class='it'>not</span> in love.
But I have heard from the Westbrooks, both of
whom I highly esteem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he still hesitated where to go, Thomas
Grove, a cousin of his mother’s, invited him to
Cwm Elan, a wild corner of Radnorshire. Here
he could economize while awaiting his allowance.
He accepted the Groves’ invitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his way through London he would have
liked to have seen Miss Kitchener and have taken
her to lunch. But the school-teacher with the
Roman nose feared this would not be quite a
proper thing to do, there was such an immense
social difference between her and Mr. Shelley.
Indignant at the mere idea, Shelley wrote her a
long letter on equality, in which he addressed her
as “his soul’s sister.” Miss Kitchener began to
think that Lady Shelley was a fine name and to
study her reflection in the looking-glass.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <br/> THIS DESPOTIC CHAIN .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Now for the first time Shelley was among mountain
solitudes, and heard the voices of mountain
torrents, but the power of hills was not upon him.
“This is most divine scenery,” he wrote to Hogg,
“but all very dull, stale, flat, and unprofitable;
indeed, the place is a very great bore.” Sitting
near some tree-shaded waterfall he passed his time
in reading and re-reading the letters he received
from his friends. He was the director of
innumerable “souls”: Miss Kitchener, the faithful
Hogg, Captain Pilfold, the terror of the pious,
Eliza and Harriet Westbrook, without counting
many whose names are unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Westbrooks had just gone back to London
when he received from Harriet a most disturbing
letter. Her father insisted on her returning to
Mrs. Fenning’s school where she had been so
miserable, where her schoolfellows had sent her
to Coventry, and called her “an abandoned
wretch.” Rather than exist in such a prison she
would kill herself. “Why live? No one loves
me, and I have no one to love. Is suicide a crime
in one who is useless to others and insupportable
to herself? Since there is no law of God, has the
law of man any right to forbid so natural an
action?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sort of terror seized Shelley. This schoolgirl
logic appeared irrefutable, and it was he who
had formed her mind. How then could he answer
her with calculated coldness and abandon her to
death? He wrote advising firmness; before
despairing she should resist, she should refuse to
return to school, and he himself wrote Mr. Westbrook
a letter of expostulation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old publican was outraged. What right
had this young sprig of nobility to interfere? He
had been dangling after the Westbrook girls for
six months or more, and Eliza imagined he would
marry Harriet, but when had a future baronet
ever married the daughter of a tavern-keeper?
The young fellow wanted, evidently, something
very different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Westbrook had sized him up the evening he
had first met him in Harriet’s bedroom. He had
invited him to come down and take a glass in the
parlour, and Mr. Shelley had refused with
disdain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How could the grandson of Sir Bysshe Shelley,
the wealthy baronet, be a Friend of the People,
or a believer in Equality? Bah! the Upper Ten
were all exactly the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet was ordered to get ready for Clapham.
She wrote to Shelley again a letter in which a
somewhat less lugubrious plan replaced that of
suicide. She was too miserable at home, too
cruelly persecuted, but she was ready to elope with
him if he would consent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He instantly took the coach for London in
indescribable agitation of mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That he was partly responsible for Harriet he
could not doubt. He had formed her, he had
inspired her with exalted courage, and the horror
of injustice. It was a letter from him which had
brought about her first disgrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if he eloped with her how should they live?
He had no profession, no prospects—and did he
really love her? Could he love anyone again after
the blighting of his young hopes by his cousin?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, Harriet was charming, and there was
something intoxicating in the idea of a journey
in the company of the lovely creature he had seen
one night in bed, with unbound auburn hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was difficult to repel even warmer ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he saw her again her face was pale,
wasted, tragic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have made you suffer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” She hesitated to say, “I
suffer because I am in love with you,” but her
eyes, lifted to his, confessed the truth. She was
madly in love with him. He had completely transformed
her. Before meeting him she had had all
the normal tastes of the British schoolgirl. She
had adored the red coats of the military, and when
she wove day-dreams the hero was always an
officer. But when she dreamed of marriage the
hero became a black-coated clergyman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley had overthrown all such reasonable
ideals. The first time she had heard him declaim
on religion or politics, she had been frightened,
and made up her mind to convert him. But at
the outset his logic had crushed her, and conquered
by an antagonist so greatly her superior,
she found nothing but pleasure in her defeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had decided not to join them in Wales,
she was afraid she had lost him, and in writing
to him had exaggerated her hardships in order to
bring her hero back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley had little admiration for Knight Errantry,
which struck him as senseless. A man has
no right to devote to Woman a life which should
be consecrated to the service of Humanity. But
looking on Harriet’s exquisite face, which a single
word from him could suffuse with happiness, he
gave his principles the go-by. He took her hand
in his, and declared himself hers heart and soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A last rag of prudence made him decide against
an immediate elopement. It was dangerous and
needless to force events. If they tried to coerce
her, she had but to make a sign to him, he would
fly to her from the ends of the earth and carry her
off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more her face glowed with the rosy
happiness of the young girl who knows she is
beloved.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the moment he had left her, he sighed
deeply and fell into embarrassment and melancholy.
He wrote to describe the situation to
Hogg, and Hogg replied strongly urging his
friend not to elope with Harriet without marrying
her first. He knew all Shelley’s hostility to marriage,
but he used powerful arguments. “If you
don’t marry her, which will suffer? You or she?
Evidently she alone. It is she whom the world
will scorn. It is she who must make the
sacrifice of her reputation and her security. Have
you the right to ask this of her?” The appeal was
cleverly turned, as selfishness was of all vices the
one which Shelley most despised. But he felt too
that marriage was a shameful and immoral action.
The chapters in <span class='it'>Political Justice</span> against matrimonial
chains stuck in his mind. It was now that
some one reassured him by telling him that the
great Godwin himself had been married twice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is evidently useless,” he wrote to Hogg,
“to seek by an individual example to rejuvenate
the forms of society until such time as reason shall
have brought about so great a change, that the
reformer be no longer exposed to stoning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time he was in no hurry to apply
his new tenets. Captain Pilfold invited him to
Cuckfield; he knew he would see there his “soul’s
sister,” the handsome school-teacher with the
Roman nose. He desired to complete her initiation
in the Truth. So, again promising Harriet
to return at the first sign she should make him, he
left London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One would need to be nineteen years old to have
the smallest doubt as to what must happen. A
young girl very much in love and armed with such
a promise, does not long resist her heart’s desire.
Before a week was out an ardent message recalled
Shelley to town. The tyrants insisted on delivering
up Andromeda to the Scholastic Dragon!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley realized that there was no help for it
but to elope with Harriet, and marry her afterwards—as
soon as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day the Edinburgh Mail Coach carried
northwards these two young things whose united
ages did not exceed thirty-five.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An act of will, not an act of passion,” the
young Knight told himself, as he sat facing his
exquisite little sweetheart, while the stage jolted
and rumbled on its way.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span><h1>CHAPTER IX<br/> <br/> A VERY YOUNG COUPLE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A pair of young lovers, persecuted and charming,
exercises a fascination which is almost irresistible.
The citizens of Edinburgh, difficult to get at where
their purse is concerned, could not prevent themselves
from giving an amused and indulgent
welcome to the very young couple who arrived at
their gates in such brilliant penury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before leaving London Shelley had borrowed a
few pounds from a friend. When he got to Edinburgh
he hadn’t a penny left. It was useless to
hope for help from his father, whom the news of
his elopement must have thrown into paroxysms
of rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, he found a good-humoured landlord
to whom he told his story; this, with Harriet’s
beauty and a promise of speedy payment, induced
him to give the travellers an excellent ground-floor
flat in his house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Better still, he advanced them the money they
needed to pay their way during the first few days,
and to arrange the wedding, according to the
simple rites of the Scottish Church. His only condition
was that Shelley should treat him and his
friends to a supper on the wedding night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was in the midst of Edinburgh tradesmen
that the grandson of Sir Bysshe ate his wedding-feast.
The fumes of the wines and the spectacle
of the young people going to the heads of the
guests, these honest Puritans became a trifle too
wanton for Shelley’s taste. The jests grew ribald.
The modest Harriet blushed crimson, and Shelley
rising announced that he and his wife would say
good night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A roar of laughter was the reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later there came a knock at their door.
Shelley opened it to find his landlord, followed by
all his friends. He spoke tipsily: “It’s the
custom here when there’s a wedding, to come up
in the middle of the night and wash the bride with
whisky.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take another step into the room, and I blow
your brains out!” cried Shelley, seizing a pistol
in each hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perceiving that there was something dangerous
in this young man who looked so like a girl, the
intruders wished him a respectful good night, and
tumbled precipitately downstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Shelley and Harriet found themselves
husband and wife, free and alone in a big unknown
city. They looked at each other in rapture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days had sufficed to render the young
husband, who in the stage had reflected with
melancholy, “An act of will and not of passion,”
over head and ears in love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet was really delightful to look upon:
always pretty, always bright, always blooming,
her head well dressed, not a hair out of its place;
smart, usually plain in her neatness, without a
wrinkle, without a spot, she resembled some pink-and-white
flower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without being really cultivated she was
remarkably well-informed. She had read a
prodigious number of books, she still read all day
long, and works of a high ethical tone for choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her master, who was her lover, had given her
his own veneration for Virtue, and Fénelon’s
<span class='it'>Télémaque</span> was his favourite hero. She practised
saying over the magic words “Intolerance,”
“Equality,” “Justice,” and her child-lips uttered
maxims which would have staggered the Lord
Chancellor. As to the Anglican religion she
ignored it as completely as did Calypso and
Nausicaa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Children are delightful, but their society is
fatiguing. Fully alive to the charm, sweet
temper, and unselfishness of Harriet, nevertheless
Shelley now and again sighed for Hogg’s caustic
talk, or Miss Hitchener’s ardent enthusiasm. He
asked himself uneasily what the latter would think
of his marriage.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“My dearest Friend,” he wrote to her, “if I
may still address you so? Or have I lost,
through my equivocal conduct, the esteem of the
virtuous and the wise? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How in one week all
my plans have changed, and to what an extent
are we the slaves of circumstance! You will ask
how I, an atheist, could submit myself to the marriage
ceremony, how my conscience could ever consent
to it? This is what I want to explain to
you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thereupon, treading in Hogg’s footsteps, he
proved that one has not the right to deprive a
beloved being of all the advantages which are
bound up with a good reputation.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Blame if thou wilt, dearest friend, for <span class='it'>still</span>
thou art dearest to me, yet pity even this error if
thou blamest me. If Harriet be not at sixteen all
you are at a more advanced age, assist me to
mould a really noble soul into all that can make its
nobleness useful and lovely.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Charming she
is already unless I am the weakest of error’s
slaves.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The letter finished with an invitation that the
lady should join them at Edinburgh, where Harriet’s
presence would prevent any thought of
impropriety. Miss Kitchener did not accept.
Evidently the poetic “thee’s” and “thou’s”
were not sufficient to buy pardon for the somewhat
unfortunate reference to Harriet’s and Miss
Hitchener’s respective ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though the virgin of Cuckfield declined to
come and help in the moulding of Harriet’s soul,
one sunny morning Shelley heard a knock at the
door of his flat, and looking out of the window was
overjoyed to see Hogg standing in the street, bag
in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having just given himself a few weeks’ holiday,
he came to pass them in Edinburgh. He received
a triumphal reception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have met at last once more!” cried
Shelley. “And we will never part again! You
must have a bed in the house!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet came in. Hogg was charmed with her.
He had never seen such blooming, radiant youth
and beauty. The landlord was summoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want another bedroom, instantly,
urgently, indispensably!” When the poor man
was permitted to answer, he offered them a room
at the top of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three friends had a thousand things to tell
and to ask. They all talked at once, while a
dirty little nymph, the servant of the house,
brought in tea, with many discordant ejaculations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So soon as the excitement had somewhat subsided
Shelley proposed a walk, and they went
to visit the palace of Mary Stuart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet, as an excellent pupil of the Academy
for Young Ladies and a tireless reader of historical
romances, explained the history of the unhappy
Queen. On leaving Holyrood House Shelley
declared he must go home and write letters, but he
wished Hogg and Harriet to climb to Arthur’s Seat,
whence they would get a view of the whole city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg having admired the scene, they sat there
a long time together, and probably in such delightful
company he would have found any view
admirable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they came down, the wind having begun to
blow, displayed Harriet’s ankles, which Hogg by
a side glance examined with interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This made Harriet sit down again upon a rock
and declare she would remain there “for
ever”!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg who was desperately hungry, protested in
vain. So he left her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and presently she
came running down after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus began for the three young people some
delightful weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The money question remained an anxious one,
but jolly Uncle Pilfold sent frequent presents.
“To be confoundedly angry with his son is all
very well, but to stop the supplies is a great deal
too bad.” Hogg also had some spare cash,
although Timothy Shelley had taken the trouble
to write to Hogg senior: “I think it my duty to
warn you that my young man has just set off for
Scotland with a young female, and that your young
man has joined them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every morning Shelley would go out to fetch
his letters, the number of which remained prodigious.
After breakfast he worked at a translation
of Buffon which he had undertaken, while Hogg
and Harriet went for a walk. If the weather were
bad she read aloud to Hogg. She was fond of
reading aloud and she read remarkably well, with
a very distinct enunciation and an agreeable voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg listened to the greater part of <span class='it'>Télémaque</span>
and never complained. The virtuous Idomeneus
giving wise laws to Crete was horribly boring, but
the reader was so lovely to look upon that he
would have listened without complaining the whole
day through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley, less polite, would sometimes drop off
to sleep, and his innocent slumbers gave serious
offence. His friend would support his wife in
stigmatizing him as an inattentive wretch, Hogg
taking an unconscious pleasure in making common
cause with Harriet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the year of the famous comet and of the
still more famous vintage 1811. The nights were
clear and bright.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span><h1>CHAPTER X<br/> <br/> HOGG</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of six weeks it was necessary that
Hogg should return to York. As Shelley and
Harriet had nothing to retain them in Edinburgh,
nor indeed anywhere else in the world, they
decided to go with him. They would remain with
him in York during the year which he must still
spend in that city, and then all three would remove
to London where they would live “for ever,” writing,
reading, and being read to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not to overtire Harriet they hired a post-chaise.
On either side of the road fields of turnips alternated
monotonously with fields of barley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But which are the turnips and which is the
barley?” Harriet asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you little Cockney!” Shelley, the heir
to broad lands, exclaimed with indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silent in his corner, Hogg, the scoffer, asked
himself how it came about that the virtuous
Idomeneus had taught his disciple so little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To while away the time, Harriet read aloud in
the chaise Holcroft’s novels. The rigid, spartan,
iron tone of that stern author was not encouraging.
Bysshe sometimes sighed deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it necessary to read all that, Harriet
dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, absolutely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cannot you skip some part?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it is impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the first relay, Shelley vanished. He had
always possessed the astonishing power of vanishing
like an Elf. He was recaptured by Hogg,
who found him standing on the seashore—it was
at Berwick—gazing mournfully at the setting sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took a violent dislike to York. The theological
and civic pre-eminence of the old city had
no charm for him, and the only lodgings they
could find were dingy rooms kept by a couple of
dingy milliners in a dingy street. “It’s impossible
to stay here,” Bysshe declared. But to move
elsewhere money was needed. He decided to go
and see Captain Pilfold, protector of the good and
free; there, too, at Cuckfield, he would again meet
Miss Kitchener; perhaps he could persuade her to
go back with him to York, and on their way
through London they could pick up Eliza Westbrook,
whose company was much desired by
Harriet. And thus, for the first time, all Shelley’s
spiritual sisters would find themselves together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He therefore took the coach, and Harriet and
Hogg were left by themselves, a strange and
delicious situation. In this city, where they had no
acquaintances, they were as free as on some desert
island, and Harriet found a childish pleasure in
playing at “housekeeping” with her young and
witty companion. Hogg’s sarcastic tongue
amused her greatly, and was a relief to Shelley’s
burning seriousness which she admired so much.
Hogg was always paying her compliments, both
in Edinburgh and on the journey to York, and she
saw no harm in it. Percy was always a little bit
of “the school-master.” He had taught her all she
knew. He gravely corrected her mistakes. He
was conscious of her limitations. Hogg, on the
contrary, admired everything she did, noticed her
frocks, and the way she did her hair. He listened
to <span class='it'>Télémaque</span>, and praised the voice of the reader.
He was always gay. It was really very pleasant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg’s own sentiments were quite other and
less commendable. Living continually in the company
of this charming girl, he began to desire her
with passion. At first he told himself that this
was a terrible desire and that the wife of his best
friend could never be an object of his pursuit. But
when one is intelligent, one knows how to put
intelligence at the service of one’s desires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I to blame,” said he, “if Bysshe throws
her in my arms? What a mad notion of his to
sit and write long letters on Virtue when he
possesses an adorable creature like Harriet! For
she is ravishingly pretty. When she walks in the
street the most Puritanical run to the windows to
look at her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Does Bysshe really love her?
He shows her a rather contemptuous sort of affection,
and has some excuse for it. For Harriet
is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what? The daughter of a publican.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
She can’t be very stand-off.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ever since he first knew Shelley, two contradictory
sentiments had divided his soul. He
admired his friend’s moral courage, frankness,
and ardent loyalty. He knew him to be unique, a
diamond of the purest water. Yet, at the same
time, his sense of humour was tickled by Percy’s
declamatory vehemence, by his feverish energy
that yet accomplished nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Oxford Hogg had acted the cultured Sancho
Panza to this fair-skinned Don Quixote, and had
taken his share of the punishment meted out by
the terrible windmills. His admiration in the
beginning had triumphed over his irony, which
simply served to lend the former a more tender
hue. Now, stirred up by a guilty passion, his
irony visibly increased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the first day of Shelley’s absence, when
Hogg left his chambers he took Harriet for a walk
by the river. He gazed in her eyes with delight,
and murmured a thousand foolish things. She
talked of her husband whose return she longed
for, partly for his own sake but chiefly because
he was to bring with him her dearest Eliza.
“Eliza is very beautiful as you will see, she has
splendid hair, jet black, glossy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she is
awfully clever .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is she who has always
guided me in the important affairs of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The child has had important affairs in its
life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet spoke of her martyrdom at school .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
of the obstacles to her marriage .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she remained
pensive a moment plunged in the past
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then, “What is your opinion of suicide?
Did you never think of destroying yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never! Nor you either, I should hope?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, very often. Even at school I used
to get up in the night with the fixed intention
of killing myself. I would look out of the
window, and say good-bye to the moon and the
stars, to the sleeping girls .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then I would
go back to bed again and fall asleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The walk continued, so did their intimate talk.
Then they went home to make the tea, a ceremony
during which Hogg was always extremely funny.
After tea Harriet offered to read to him, but of
what she read to him that evening he retained no
notion. When she said “good night” and left
him, he asked himself, “Is she really <span class='it'>good</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he saw her next day he told her he was
madly in love with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet was upset and indignant. For a child
of sixteen, she defended herself fairly well. She
spoke of Shelley and of Virtue. “Don’t you see
how odious your behaviour is? Percy gave me
into your care and you betray his confidence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But I’m sure you are cured already.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Please
don’t say another word about it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And I will
say nothing to Percy so as not to grieve him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke with vivacity. Love scenes are a
pretty woman’s battlefields and soldiers enjoy
fighting. Harriet’s courage was victorious, and
Hogg promised to be good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening, when he returned from work, he
saw sitting by Harriet’s side on the sofa a big
woman, with raven-black hair, a face of a dead
white, and a horse-like profile. “Hogg, this is
Eliza, she is come, isn’t it kind of her? Eliza,
this is Hogg, our greatest friend, of whom Percy
has so often spoken to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliza shadowed him a bow from the nape of
her neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought Bysshe was to have brought you
with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh dear no!” said Eliza, and she went on
talking to Harriet and paid him no further attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg was not used to such treatment in the
Shelleys’ house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So this is Eliza?” he thought. “She is
hideous and common-looking. Here’s an end to
my flirtation with Harriet—though perhaps that’s
just as well.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harriet, dearest,” he said aloud, “aren’t we
going to have any tea to-day? You don’t take
tea, Miss Westbrook?” he inquired, turning to
her politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh dear no!” replied that lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you, Harriet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I won’t either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg resigned himself to making his own tea,
and to drinking it in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this day forth the house became insupportable.
Eliza took over, or rather resumed, the
management of everything. She had managed
Harriet her whole life through, and though she
had been obliged to relinquish her post to Shelley
during the first few weeks of marriage, she now
again took her place on the bridge like a captain
on his ship, who runs his flag up to the mast-head,
and tolerates no other authority on board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She began by criticizing severely Shelley’s conduct.
“So if I hadn’t come you would have been
left alone with this young man? It’s unbelievable!
And he calls you ‘dearest’? And you
permit him to do so! Good heavens! What
would Miss Warne say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Hogg proposed a walk, “What are you
thinking of?” said Eliza. “Harriet is very tired,
not well at all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg was astounded. “Harriet?” he
repeated. “What on earth’s the matter with
her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s her poor nerves, you must be blind not
to see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Harriet wanted to read aloud to Hogg
the virtuous counsels of Idomeneus, of which he
stood so much in need: “Read aloud, Harriet?
Whatever will become of your poor nerves?
What would Miss Warne say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who the deuce <span class='it'>is</span> Miss Warne?” Hogg asked
Harriet so soon as Eliza had gone to her room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is Eliza’s greatest friend, and we have
the highest opinion of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? Is she anything extraordinary by
birth and education?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh dear no, her father keeps a public-house
like ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg heaved a sigh and lifted his eyebrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does that dear Eliza do in her bedroom?
Does she read?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet leaned over him to say in tones of
mystery: “She brushes her hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go out, Harriet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first Harriet refused, but as the hair-brushing
was prolonged she agreed to accompany Hogg
for a few minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since his first attempt on her virtue he had kept
his promise “to be good.” She was pleased—but
disappointed. Quite sure of herself, she
would have enjoyed temptation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood on the high centre of the old Roman
bridge, there was a mighty flood. The Ouse had
overflowed his banks, carrying away with him
timber and what not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harriet dearest, think how nicely Eliza would
spin down the river! How sweetly she would
turn round and round like that log of wood.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And gracious heavens! What would Miss Warne
say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet turned away her head to hide her
laughter. Hogg said dreadful things, but really
he was too funny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have such a delightful laugh, Harriet!
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so musical, so gay!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet, full of courage, felt the battle was close
at hand.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI<br/> <br/> HOGG (<span class='it'>continued</span>)</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley returned next day, sooner than was
expected. He had had no success. His father
had refused to see him. From very different
motives to Shelley’s he too considered his son’s
marriage the unforgivable crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d have willingly supported any amount of
illegitimate children,” he told Captain Pilfold.
“But that he should have <span class='it'>married</span> her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
never speak to me of him again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Hitchener, afraid for her reputation, had
refused to make the journey with Shelley. In
London he learned that Eliza had not waited for
him. He reached York, tired and out of spirits,
hoping to find consolation in the society of his wife
and his friend. What he found was an atmosphere
of embarrassment and constraint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliza, shut up in her room, brushed her hair
all day long. Harriet and Hogg, instead of their
former gay nonsense round the tea-tray, treated
each other with studied coldness. When Hogg
spoke to her, she replied very shortly. There was
something mysterious in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment Harriet and Shelley were alone,
“Dear,” he began, “I don’t like this haughty
attitude you take with Hogg. He is my best
friend. He has looked after you in my absence.
That you now have your sister with you is no
reason for giving the cold shoulder to Hogg,
whom I look on as a brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet sighed. “He’s a nice sort of friend!”
said she, in a tone heavy with insinuations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley, astonished, urged her to explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told the story. “He has made love to me
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. twice. The first time he told me he was
passionately in love with me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I pretended
it was a joke.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I made him be quiet. I
imagined it was all over, and I even had no intention
of speaking to you about it. But yesterday
he began again. He declared he couldn’t live
without me, and that he will kill himself if I don’t
consent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley felt his blood freeze. His heart seemed
to stand still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hogg? Hogg did this? But did you not
point out to him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I said everything I could say .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that
he was a false friend, that he was betraying your
confidence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘What does all that matter
when one is in love?’ he replied. ‘It’s all right
for Percy, who is a cold and pure spirit, to talk
of virtue .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I’m in love with you, and the
rest doesn’t count.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Besides, what harm
should we do Shelley? He need never know.
Why not give me your love, and give him your
affection? Does he think so much about you?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and lots of other things as well. He
said you mix logic with things where it has no
business, that you are a flame for ideas, and ice
for the sentiments which alone count in life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I answered him as well as I was able.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley let himself fall upon the sofa. Suddenly
the world seemed eclipsed behind a veil of
grey. He was seized with giddiness, his head
swam, he shivered with cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That Hogg should have tried to seduce my
wife, taking advantage of the moment that I had
confided her to his protection .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hogg, on
whose countenance I have sometimes gazed till I
fancied the world could be reformed by gazing
too.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Never was there a more shameful
attempt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And yet when I think of Oxford,
of his nobility and disinterestedness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I must
talk with him, I must make him see reason.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed Harriet tenderly, and begged Hogg to
walk with him to the fields beyond York. Hogg
knew there must be a scene. He was prepared for
it. He denied nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s true. I’ve been in love with Harriet
since the first day I saw her in Edinburgh. Is it
my fault? I can’t resist beauty in women, and
Harriet is admirably beautiful. I repeat I fell in
love with her at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not love but lust. A low animal instinct.
Not the exalted passion which differentiates Man
from the brute. Love? Think a little, Hogg.
Love supposes self-forgetfulness, and the desire
for the happiness of the beloved object. You
could only bring about Harriet’s misery. Therefore,
your feelings are not those of love, but of
egotism.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call it what you like.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What do words
signify? It is, anyhow, a terrible passion, which
I should have fought against had I not felt it
was invincible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No passion is invincible. Our will can always
be victorious. Had you thought of me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This
revelation has aged and broken me more than
twenty years of misery could have done.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my
heart seems seared .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then there is
Harriet, do you not suppose that all this has been
very painful for her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg was pale, cast-down. He looked ashamed
and unhappy, and he felt so. For he too loved
Shelley and he blamed his own conduct severely.
“No woman in the world,” he thought, “is
worth the sacrifice of such a friend.” Then aloud,
“I’m awfully sorry, Bysshe, for what has
happened. I’ll try to forget, and do you and
Harriet try to forgive me. Let us begin life anew
as it was before. Don’t be angry with me any
longer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not angry with you, I hate your crime, but
not yourself. I hope that one day you will regard
this horrible error with as much disgust as I do.
When that day comes, you will no longer be
responsible for it. The man who feels remorse is
no longer the man who was guilty. It is certainly
not I who would ever reproach you, for I value a
human being not for what it has been, but for
what it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley felt such satisfaction at having trodden
down his anger and his jealousy, at having discovered
for Hogg the way of salvation, that the
offence was almost forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But women are much less indulgent. When
Shelley on going home announced that he had forgiven
the criminal: “What!” cried Eliza, “you
mean to go on living with that fellow? Good
heavens! What will become of Harriet’s poor
nerves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg, coming in from his chambers next day,
found an empty house.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII<br/> <br/> FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH MIDDLE AGE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley and the two girls, in their flight from the
deplorable Hogg, had decided to go to the Lakes.
There was a sentimental reason for this, very like
his choice of Poland Street. Two great poets,
both Liberals, Southey and Coleridge, had long
lived in the Lake District and by some happy
chance it might be that Shelley would make their
acquaintance. Nothing could have delighted him
more than to meet some of the rare great minds
that shared his ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Shelleys found at Keswick a small furnished
cottage set in flowers. They had no right
to the garden, but the landlord, who looked upon
Shelley and Harriet as little better than a pair of
strayed children, allowed them to run about in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The postman soon came to know the weight of
Shelley’s letter-bag. First, there was the correspondence
with Hogg, which was very discouraging.
He wrote long letters to Harriet in which
he swore to respect her, and at the same time, to
adore her during time and eternity. Such
unasked-for constancy wearied her, yet her pride
fed on it. When Shelley said, “Time and distance
will make him forget you,” she shook her
head with an air of scepticism. Really sorry for
the unhappiness of her admirer, she would perhaps
have been more sorry to believe it could be
cured: “Distance,” said she, “may ease trifling
griefs, but only increases great ones.” When
Hogg wrote, “Either Harriet must forgive me or
I’ll blow out my brains at her feet,” she triumphed
and was sad. But when no pistol-shot came to
shatter their flowery solitude, she was reassured—and
disappointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, there were the letters of Miss Hitchener
who, since the fall of Hogg, had become Shelley’s
only confidante. Nearly every day he sent her a
few urgent and exemplary pages. Harriet would
often add to her husband’s eloquent dissertations a
warm invitation to come and join them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duke of Norfolk lived in the neighbourhood.
He had already brought about one reconciliation
between Shelley and his father, and as the
money question became more and more serious
they decided to write to him again. The Duke
replied by inviting Shelley, his wife, and his sister-in-law
to spend the week-end at Greystoke. He
took an interest in the young man possibly
through natural benevolence, possibly because it
was his duty, as head of a great political party, to
win the friendship of one, destined it would seem
when he came of age, to go into Parliament, and
to inherit £6,000 a year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet, at Greystoke, bore herself with grace.
The Duchess, who had been told the story of
Shelley’s extraordinary marriage, was agreeably
surprised by the beauty and good manners of his
wife. Even Eliza was considered “quite charming,”
at least according to Harriet. The visit was
successful. When Mr. Westbrook knew that his
daughters had stayed with a duke, and that his
son-in-law had arrived at the castle with only a
guinea in his pocket, he felt the sudden need to
show himself generous, and he offered the young
couple an allowance of £200 a year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Shelley could not be less open-handed, above
all when his suzerain and chief asked him to be
clement. He agreed once more to allow his son
£200 a year: and thus all danger of poverty came
to an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in Percy’s eyes the chief satisfaction lay in
having obtained these important results without
any concessions on his part: “I think it my duty
to say that however great advantages might
result from such concessions I can make no
promise of concealing my opinions in political or
religious matters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Such methods as these
would be unworthy of us both.” His father
answered: “If I make you an allowance it is
simply to prevent you from swindling strangers.”
So incapable was he of rising to the height of
Shelley’s ideas.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Greystoke Shelley made acquaintance with
William Calvert, a friend of Southey’s, who
offered to take him to call on the poet. Thus, for
the first time, he was to see in the flesh one of
the writers he most admired. But when he
actually met Southey he was intensely surprised,
for he had always associated the idea of a poet
with the most entrancing and aerial of beings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What he found, in a well-furnished and well-warmed
house, was a Mrs. Southey resembling
far more a cook-housekeeper than a Muse. She
had been in point of fact a dressmaker, and she
bound her husband’s books with remnants of the
gowns she had made. Her linen-closets were the
sanctuaries in which she exercised her talents, and
her conversation was of money, cooking, and servants,
like the most boring of housewives. The
poet seemed insensible to the ignominy of it all.
He was an honest creature, but with no reasoning
powers. He admitted the social system needed
changing, but declared that change could only
come very slowly. He made use of the odious
formula, “Neither you nor I will live to see it.”
He was opposed to Catholic Emancipation and
Parliamentary reform. Worst of all, he called
himself a Christian! Grieved to the heart,
Shelley left him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Southey, worthy man, was far from imagining
the impression he had made. “An extraordinary
boy!” thought he, after his visitor had gone.
“His chief sorrow seems to be that he is heir to
an immense property, and he is as much worried
by the notion that he will have £6,000 a year, as
I used to be at his age by the knowledge that I
hadn’t a penny. Apart from this, he acts upon me
as my own ghost would do. He is just what I
was in 1794. He thinks himself an Atheist but is
really a Pantheist: a childish ailment through
which we have all passed. It is lucky he has
fallen on me. He could not have a better doctor.
I have prescribed Berkeley and before the week is
out he will be a Berkeleian. It has surprised him
a good deal to meet for the first time in his life
with a man who perfectly understands him and
does him full justice.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. God help us! The
world wants mending, though he does not set
about it exactly in the right way. Yet I do not
despair of convincing him that he may do a great
deal of good with £6,000 a year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus did Youth and Middle Age meet upon
their way, and the former looked at the latter with
respect, but with impatience. But the Middle
Age looked at Youth with a kindly irony, and
promised himself to dominate it by the strength of
a more cultivated mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Middle Age forgot that the minds of different
generations are as impenetrable one by the other
as are the monads of Leibniz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Southey and his wife did all in their power to
be of service to the young couple. He persuaded
Shelley’s landlord to reduce the weekly rent of
Chestnut Cottage. Mrs. Southey gave poor
Harriet, who knew nothing of housekeeping, excellent
advice on cookery and laundry work. She
even lent her bed-and-table-linen, which was the
high-water mark of favour. But a discovery
which Shelley now made rendered useless every
advance on the part of Middle Age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He read by chance in a review an article by
Southey in which he spoke of George III as “the
best King who had ever sat upon a throne.” A
blatant piece of flattery, of course, but Southey
aspired to be Poet Laureate, and the road to
official honours is steep to climb. Shelley never
pardoned baseness of this sort. He wrote to him
that henceforward he should look upon him as a
wage-earning slave, an upholder of crime, and he
would see him no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at this precise moment he troubled himself
very little about Southey, for he had just discovered
Godwin, the great Godwin, the author of
<span class='it'>Political Justice</span>, the destroyer of marriage, the
enemy of the divinity, the atheist, republican and
revolutionary. Godwin was still alive, he lived
in London, he had a postal address like everybody
else, one could send letters on Virtue to Virtue’s
own high prophet!</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be surprised,” he wrote, “to receive
a letter from a stranger. No introduction has
authorized that which ordinary men would describe
as a liberty. But it is a liberty, which if
not sanctioned by custom, is far from being
blamable by reason. The dearest interests of
humanity demand that fashionable etiquette
should not divide man from man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The name of Godwin has been used to excite
in me feelings of reverence and admiration. I
have been accustomed to consider him a luminary
too dazzling for the darkness which surrounds
him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You will not, therefore, be surprised
at the inconceivable emotions with which I learnt
your existence and your dwelling. I had enrolled
your name in the list of the honourable dead. It
is not so. You still live, and I firmly believe are
still planning the welfare of human kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have but just entered on the scene of human
operations, yet my feelings and my reasonings
correspond with what yours were. My course has
been short, but eventful.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The ill-treatment
I have met with has more than ever impressed the
truth of my principles on my judgment.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>When Godwin received this letter he was well
pleased. Much talked of at the moment that
<span class='it'>Political Justice</span> appeared, he had fallen back since
into comparative neglect. He, too, though with
less reason than his young disciple, could talk of
an “eventful life.” He began his career as a
clergyman, and at the age of thirty was an avowed
atheist and republican.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1793 he had published his famous book. Pitt
was in half a mind to have him prosecuted for
it, but the high price of the work—it was sold
at six guineas—had seemed to the Prime Minister
a sufficient protection against its dangerous
teaching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four years later Godwin had married Mary
Wollstonecraft, a woman writer of genius, with
whom he had been living. She had died in giving
birth to a daughter, and the inveterate enemy
of marriage at once married a second time, a certain
Mrs. Clairmont. This lady, who was a
widow, lived in the next house to his, and had
made his acquaintance by addressing gross flattery
to him from her balcony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The couple led a thorny life. There were five
children, the offspring of complicated crossings.
First, the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft and
Godwin, by Genius out of Genius; she was named
Mary. Then two children from Mrs. Clairmont’s
first marriage, Jane and Charles. Thirdly, a little
boy, son of Godwin and Mrs. Clairmont. Finally,
the eldest in age, was a young girl who no longer
belonged to anyone in the house, the daughter of
Mary Wollstonecraft and her American lover,
Captain Gilbert Imlay. This was the gentle and
attractive Fanny Imlay, the Cinderella of the
household.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second Mrs. Godwin, “a disgusting
woman who wore green spectacles,” had a mendacious
tongue and a nasty temper. She treated
Fanny and Mary with harshness, and managed the
Juvenile Library in Skinner Street, which Godwin
had started in order to earn the living of his own
juveniles. The poor Philosopher led a sorrowful
and difficult existence, entirely weaned from any
sops to his vanity. On this account, a disciple
writing him an enthusiastic letter from Keswick
was extremely welcome. For a publisher of
Children’s Books snowed under by Bills of
Exchange, nothing could be more opportune than
the acquaintance of a man who considered him as
a luminary too dazzling for close inspection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered Shelley’s letter by saying he
should be glad to have a few personal details concerning
his unknown correspondent. By return of
post he received an autobiography, in which
Timothy Shelley and the Dean of Oxford played
ignoble parts. He was informed that his correspondent
would inherit £6,000 a year, that he was
married to a woman who shared all his ideas, and
that he had already published two novels and a
pamphlet, all of which he was sending to “the
regulator and former” of his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This enthusiastic epistle was read with great
excitement by the young girls of the Godwin-Clairmont
household, but the author of <span class='it'>Political
Justice</span> was somewhat dubious about it. Since
becoming himself the father of a family, he valued
paternal authority more highly than heretofore.
Possibly, Mr. Timothy Shelley had only acted in
his son’s interests? One ought not to criticize
the powers that be when one is young, above all
one ought not to publish such criticisms. While
yet a scholar, one ought to have no intolerable itch
to become a teacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had anyone but the “venerated” Godwin
written this he would have been relegated at once
to the class of stipended upholders of Intolerance.
But Authority and Hierarchies are so essential to
Youth, even to rebellious Youth, that it humbles
itself with delight before the chosen director of its
conscience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mystic side of Shelley’s nature had more
need than another’s of some shrine at which to
worship. “I am willing to become a scholar; nay
a pupil,” he replied. “My humility and confidence
is unfeigned and complete, where I am conscious
that I am not imposed upon, and where I
perceive talents and powers so undoubtedly
superior.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his delight at having discovered Godwin, he
mapped out the vastest schemes. To completely
change the lives of others, to join their destiny to
his own, appeared to him child’s play. Hadn’t he
succeeded perfectly in the case of Harriet and of
Eliza? What could be simpler than to hire a big
house in Wales and there have Miss Kitchener,
Godwin, his “venerated” friend, and the whole
of Godwin’s charming family to live with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But first, being slightly stung by Godwin’s
scepticism, he wished to prove in a striking
manner that despite his youth he knew how to act.
Before settling down “for ever” in the Welsh
“Home of Meditation,” he would go to Ireland
with Harriet and Eliza, and there spend three
months working for Catholic Emancipation in particular,
and the improvement of the distressful
country in general.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How were the fair Harriet and Eliza of the
much-brushed hair going to emancipate the Irish
Catholics? The question was left unanswered,
but Shelley took with him “An Address to the
Irish,” so full of philosophy, wise counsels, and
love of humanity, that it seemed impossible the
mere reading of it would not touch every heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus did the young Knight Errant of the
luminous eyes take ship to conquer the Green
Island. In place of a lance he carried a manuscript,
the Beauteous Harriet was his lady and the
Black Eliza his squire; the latter being in charge
of the money, the housekeeping, and all the dirty
jobs.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <br/> SOAP BUBBLES</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The Knight of the Rueful Countenance got stoned
by the galley-slaves whom he wished to free.
Shelley was greeted with cat-calls when, at a meeting
of the friends of Catholic Emancipation, he
affirmed that it was harmful to refuse public
employment to the Irish because of their religion,
since one religion is as good as another. His
audience much preferred the fanaticism of its persecutors
to the scepticism of its defender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The famous Address was on the same subject.
It showed that Catholic Emancipation is a step on
the road to total emancipation, and that morality
and not expediency should be the principle of
politics. Instead of expecting their freedom from
the British, the Irish should free themselves by
becoming sober, just, and charitable. Shelley
imagined that his teaching would go straight to
the heart of the poor Dubliners, and he held himself
ready for martyrdom in the cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet was not less enthusiastic, and her
reforming ardour was a joy to behold. With
pockets stuffed with pamphlets, the young couple
walked up and down Sackville Street, and when
they met anyone with a “likely air” they slipped
a soul-saving paper into his hand; or from the
balcony of their lodgings they spread sound
doctrine by dropping Addresses on the heads of
the passers-by. When Shelley put one adroitly
into the hood of an old woman’s cloak, Harriet,
ready to die of laughter, was obliged to rush
away. The conversion of the Irish was assuredly
the most amusing of games. Godwin and Miss
Kitchener expected every day to hear of Shelley’s
arrest. The school-teacher even considered the
possibility of a political assassination. But
Dublin Castle learned with composure that a young
Englishman, nineteen years of age, had just made
a speech on Virtue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The police sent a copy of the Address to the
Secretary of State, and Shelley’s advice to the
Irish on sobriety and toleration struck the official
mind as a screaming joke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such impunity was very discouraging, nor were
the ways of the Irish themselves any less so.
“The reason they drink so much whisky,” said
kind-hearted Harriet, “is because meat is so
dear.” When Shelley tried to save some wretched
creature run in for theft or brawling, the policeman,
with a smile of pity, would prove to him the
man was drunk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On St. Patrick’s Night everybody was drunk,
and there was a ball at the Castle. Percy and
Harriet watched the starving people crowd round
the State carriages to admire the finery. Such
a want of dignity reduced Percy to despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That they themselves might set an example of
plain living, all three became vegetarians, and
Shelley thus freed himself from the remorse he felt
when thinking of the “horrors of the slaughterhouse”
and the “massacre of the bird-innocents.”
They only broke the rule when Mrs. Nugent came
to dinner. She was their sole acquaintance in
Dublin, a dressmaker by trade. It was just one
of the difficulties of their position that they knew
nobody amongst these Irish whom they loved so
much. “I suppose,” said Harriet, “that the
moment Percy becomes famous we shall know
everybody all at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Shelley himself hadn’t much hope. In the
land of baseless and visionary fabrics where he
usually wandered down-trodden Ireland figured as
a proud and beautiful female, Shelley as a knight-errant
and apostle, ready to fight for her and die
if need be: crowds of tatterdemalions followed them
in the streets: barbarous British soldiers stopped
him and cudgelled him: but the heroic sweetness
of his gospel tamed the brutes themselves, and
philosophy worked the miracle of reconciling
hostile races.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little by little this brilliant fantasy melted away,
the last shred of rainbow-tinted mist floated over
dirt-blackened houses, and the real Ireland loomed
up, a huge solid mass of towns, farms, forests, an
incalculable number of obscure and dissimilar men,
a heap of immemorial traditions and laws; the
land of gambling, hunting, and blood-feuds; seat
of the magistrature, garrison for the soldiery,
centre for the police; Ireland wretched but jeering,
suffering but garrulous, discontented, and
rejoicing in her discontent. The Enigmatical
Island .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Absurd Island.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Gazing at
the terrifying Reality, what could he do? What
could he hope for? He was crushed and tired out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With growing insistence Godwin urged his
disciple to give up the game. Ever since Shelley
had hailed him as a spiritual father he had adopted
the paternal tone, a grumbling and hostile one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Believe me, Shelley,” he prophesied, “you
are preparing a bath of blood!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could he have seen his spiritual son drawing
up an inoffensive “Proposal for an Association
for the Good of Mankind,” with Eliza on one side
sewing at a crimson cloak, and Harriet, preparing
a meal of bread and honey on the other, he might
have felt more tranquil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, his exhortations were so far useful
that they gave Shelley a decent excuse to give up
rescuing the oppressed who didn’t want to be
rescued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minus a few poor creatures who knew how to
sponge on him successfully, no one in Dublin took
him seriously. For if in the eyes of an Irishman
there is any one being more ridiculous than an
Englishman, it is an Englishman who loves
Ireland, and if in the whole world there is any one
spectacle which an old Eton boy and Oxford man
cannot endure, it is Irish disorder and dirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having seen close at hand the folly and the
misery of the people, his thoughts turned with
longing to the beauty and peace of the English
country-side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I give in,” he wrote to his “venerated”
friend. “Never again will I address myself to the
ignorant.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I will content myself with being
the cause of an effect which will manifest itself
years after I myself am dust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet packed up all the remaining pamphlets
and forwarded them to Miss Kitchener, who could
have very well done without this “inflammable
matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliza folded up the crimson cloak, and the three
apostles took the boat back to England.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second part of their programme was now
to be carried out, the house in Wales, where the
“spiritual flock” could be brought together, and
<span class='it'>all</span> problems solved. They thought they had found
just the very thing, in the district where Shelley
had stayed before his marriage. The wildness and
beauty of the country attracted him. Near the
house a mountain torrent brawled over the stones,
and formed pools on which he had floated a little
boat a foot long. His sail had been a £5 note:
a terrified cat his passenger. He hoped that Miss
Hitchener would persuade her father to come and
farm the property of one hundred and thirty acres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the affair hung fire. The house was too
dear. Mr. Hitchener, indignant at the Cuckfield
slanders concerning Shelley and his daughter,
refused to let her go to Nantgwillt. The school-teacher,
proud of the invitation she had received,
had very imprudently boasted of it to every one,
and every one, led by Aunt Pilford, construed it
in the worst possible way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again was Shelley astounded by the
world’s malignancy. He, who had run away with
his wife, and made a Scotch love-marriage, how
could anyone suppose he would be unfaithful to
Harriet! The idea caused him such an overwhelming
surprise that a less virtuous woman than
Miss Hitchener might have been offended by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Mr. Hitchener, he got the treatment he
merited. He, too, was a retired public-house
keeper, for the gods seemed to delight in putting
the crystalline Shelley in connection with “the
trade.” “Sir,” he wrote to the lady’s father,
“I have some difficulty in repressing my indignant
astonishment on hearing that <span class='it'>you</span> refuse my
invitation to <span class='it'>your daughter</span>. By what right?
Who made you her master? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Neither the laws
of Nature nor yet those of England have put
children on the footing of personal property.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Adieu. When next I hear from you I hope that
time will have liberalized your sentiments.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the Shelleys were going to leave Wales,
Godwin mentioned to them a most desirable cottage
which one of his friends wanted to let. His advice
was always respected. Shelley and Harriet went
to see the cottage and found it hopeless. The
house was commonplace, scarcely finished and far
too small for them. But, on their way back from
this useless journey, they discovered a very
picturesque village. Thirty cottages with thatched
roofs covered with climbing roses and myrtles,
formed the delightful hamlet of Lynmouth. By a
miracle, one of the cottages was to let. It was the
best situated, above a wooded gorge. From the
windows you looked down upon the sea, three
hundred feet below. They instantly decided to
settle there “for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “venerated friend,” on news of this, wrote
a stiff letter. He said, harshly, that the tastes of
the Shelleys were too luxurious, and that a small
house, modest as it might be, ought to suffice for
one who called himself Godwin’s disciple. Had
Timothy Shelley written such a letter the most
violent epithets would have been hurled at his
head, but one naturally accepts from a stranger
what one would never put up with from one’s own
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley did not think of complaining, but of
justifying himself. If he had said that the house
recommended by his guide, philosopher, and friend
was too small, this was not from a wish for
luxury, or even for comfort. But the number of
rooms was too few, and it seemed to him hardly
the thing for two persons of opposite sex and
unmarried to share the same bedroom. He knew
that in a regenerated society this prejudice would
disappear, but in the present state of things,
promiscuity appeared to him imprudent. However,
he advanced this opinion—which he feared
was rather reactionary—with precaution. The
Master was good enough to forget it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The adorable cottage at Lynmouth was soon the
scene of a great event, the arrival of Miss
Hitchener. Shelley promised himself that she
would add to his life the element of intellectual
collaboration, so far rather wanting to it. Nor
would Harriet lose anything by the arrangement,
for her “spiritual sister” would help him to form
her, both young women being, he thought, sufficiently
high-minded to accept these parts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With surprise the Lynmouth villagers now saw
him set off of a morning on long expeditions with
this gaunt, bony stranger. And henceforth it was
with her that he discussed all plans for the propagation
of his ideas. The diffusion of Virtue was
growing difficult. A London printer had just been
sentenced to the pillory. The fate of Galileo did
not frighten Shelley for himself, but he would not
thrust an innocent printer into danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily, the Magician had at his disposal ways
and means which defied the police of Lord Castlereagh.
When he had written some fine incendiary
pamphlet, he would put it in a little box, well
resined and waxed, with a lead below and a tiny
mast and sail above, and launch it on the ocean, or
he would make small fire-balloons, and having
loaded them with Wisdom set them sailing up into
the summer sky. Or he would watch entranced
a flotilla of dark-green bottles tightly corked, and
each containing a divine remedy, rise and sink as
the emerald waves swayed them seaward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he had “worked” hard in this manner,
his favourite relaxation was blowing soap-bubbles.
Seated before the door, churchwarden in hand, he
blew glassy spheres that reflected all the forms and
colours of heaven and earth upon their tenuous
surfaces. He watched them float away until they
broke and vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then quitting for a short time the aërial, translucent
palaces of Logic, he experienced the need
of fixing in verse, the intangible beauty of these
shimmering violets, greens, and golds.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <br/> THE VENERATED FRIEND</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The roses of Lynmouth were fading, and autumn
winds swept the loose clouds like dead leaves across
the sky. Miss Hitchener’s star was about to set.
The constant presence of a stranger wearied
Harriet. Shelley himself saw the dream dissolve,
revealing grosser forms, and was surprised to find
installed at his side a mediocre and twaddling
woman. He sought his heroine in vain, and
repented of his folly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After having insisted so strenuously in dragging
her from her school it was difficult to send her back
there. Yet to go on living with her in an
autumnal solitude was becoming unbearable.
Perhaps in a big city other friends and other distractions
might help him to forget the obsession
of her company. At the same time, Godwin urged
the Shelleys to come back to London. They
resolved to go and make a long stay.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with great excitement that one day in
October 1812, they left their hotel in St. James’s
Street to pay their first visit to Godwin and his
family. Harriet, tiny, fair, and rosy, tripped by
the side of her tall and round-shouldered boy-husband.
They wondered what sort of welcome
the Great Man was going to give them? Miss
Hitchener, who had called in Skinner Street on her
way through London, had met with a cold
welcome. But maybe that proved nothing but the
perspicacity of Godwin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found the whole family gathered together
in the dwelling-house above the Juvenile Library,
for the Godwins, on their side, were devoured with
curiosity to see the Shelleys. There was the
Philosopher himself, short, fat, bald, intellectual-looking,
with the appearance of a Methodist
parson, like almost all the theorists of
Revolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second Mrs. Godwin had put on her best
black silk, and only wore the green-glasses just
for the time needed to take stock of the Baronet’s
grandson and his pretty wife. The Shelleys had
been warned that she was a back-biter, but on this
occasion she showed herself amiable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fanny Imlay was there too, gentle and pensive;
and Jane Clairmont, a beautiful and vivacious
brunette of the Italian type.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only one absent,” said Godwin, “is my
daughter Mary now in Scotland. She is very like
her mother whose portrait I will show you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the young couple into his study, and
Shelley, much moved, looked long at the portrait
of the fascinating Mary Wollstonecraft. Then
every one sat down and Godwin and Percy talked
of the relativity of matter to spirit, of the position
of the clergy, and of German literature. The
women listened in mute admiration. Harriet
thought that Godwin resembled Socrates; he had
the same bulgy forehead; and that Percy sitting
beside him was like one of the handsome Greek
youths whose ardent impatience was tempered
with respect.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>A close intimacy began between the Shelleys and
the Godwins. Godwin often came round to the
hotel to take Shelley for a walk, or Mrs. Godwin
invited Harriet and Percy to dinner. She even
invited Eliza and Miss Hitchener, but the last very
unwillingly. Sometimes Harriet ventured to give
a dinner herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 5th November, Guy Fawkes’ Day, the
Shelleys dined with the Godwins. After dinner
little William Godwin, aged nine, said he was
going round to let off fireworks with his friend
and neighbour, young Newton. Shelley at this
moment was discussing some profound question
or other with his venerated friend. But the word
“fireworks” instantly brought to life the
alchemist of Field Place. He hesitated just a
second between Godwin and his discourse, and
the joy of rockets and catherine wheels lighting up
with their many-coloured fires the old London
streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, “I’ll go with you,” he said to the little
boy, and off they went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the fireworks were over, young Newton,
enchanted by this grown-up friend who played like
a boy and could tell such wonderful stories, took
him home to introduce him to his parents. Shelley
made no resistance, and never had to regret it.
He found the Newtons adorable. They fell at once
into free, cultured and agreeable talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Newton was just the man to please Shelley. He
had endless theories which he put into practice.
One of his favourite ideas was that when Man
migrated from the equatorial regions and pushed
northwards, he adopted unnatural habits and that
from these sprang all his woes. One of such bad
habits was the wearing of clothes: Newton’s
children ran about the house entirely naked.
Another bad habit was the eating of flesh food; the
whole Newton family was vegetarian. Nothing
could arouse more surely Shelley’s enthusiasm, and
Mr. Newton supplied him with new arguments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man has no similarity with any carnivorous
animal; he is without claws to hold his prey; the
formation of his teeth points out that his food
should be vegetables and fruit. He first knew
sickness after taking to flesh-eating which, for
him, is poison. Here you have the meaning of
the story of Prometheus which is evidently a
vegetarian myth. Prometheus, that is to say Man,
discovered fire and invented cooking; immediately
a vulture began to gnaw at his liver. The vulture
is hepatitis, that’s quite clear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the Newtons had taken to vegetarianism
they had never needed any doctors nor any drugs.
The children were the healthiest in the world, and
Shelley, who had many opportunities of seeing the
little girls, found them beautiful as sculptor’s
models.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He became a constant visitor, and the moment
his voice was heard in the hall the five children
rushed downstairs to meet him, and take him up
with them to the nursery. Mrs. Newton and her
sister Madame de Boinville were just as infatuated
with him as were the children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Godwin’s Fanny and Jane passed whole evenings
in listening to him with ecstasy. They raved
of his beauty, and his arguments appeared to them
unassailable. Even in a family of republicans this
young aristocrat, heir to an immense fortune and
so disdainful of money, shone with a romantic light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for him, between the two young girls,
Fanny, gentle and reserved, Jane, hot-blooded and
vehement, he seemed to be back again in those
happy days of youthful fervour and high
enthusiasm, when a bevy of adoring sisters and
cousins clipt him round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet pleased the Godwin girls less. They
noticed that she never thought for herself but
simply repeated her husband’s favourite phrases
and that her grammar was faulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor dear Shelley!” said they, as soon as the
couple had left them. “He certainly has not got
the wife he ought to have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is an impression very general amongst
young women who see the man they would have
liked themselves in the possession of another.
They even ventured to attack Harriet, in her
absence, with tiny pin-pricks; they guessed
intuitively those criticisms to which her doctrinaire
husband would be most sensitive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harriet frightens me,” wrote Fanny, “she is
such a fine lady.” Shelley was indignant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harriet a ‘fine lady’? And it is you who
accuse her of this crime, in my eyes, the most
unforgivable of any. The ease and simplicity of
her manners have always been her greatest charm,
and are incompatible with the vulgar brilliancy of
fashionable life. You will not convert me to your
opinion, so long as I have before my eyes the living
witness of its falsity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on, this letter of Fanny’s came back to
Shelley’s mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg, now fully reconciled with his family,
returned to London after a year’s exile at York to
finish his law studies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening as he sat reading in a comfortable
arm-chair wrapped in a warm dressing-gown, a
pot of hot tea by his side, he heard a tremendous
knocking at the outer door of the house. Then
this door was flung violently back against the wall,
so that the whole building shook; Hogg recalled
a pair of luminous eyes, a tall and stooping
figure.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Shelley were still friends with me, I should
imagine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some one rushing upstairs recalled rapid footsteps
heard long ago on an Oxford staircase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one but Shelley ever ran upstairs like
that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room-door opened, and there Shelley stood,
hatless, with shirt-collar wide open, wild-looking,
intellectual, always the image of some heavenly
spirit come down to earth by mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got your address from your ‘special
pleader’ fellow, and not without trouble! He
took me for a swindler of some kind and didn’t
want to give it to me. What has become of you
all this last year? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ve just got back from
Ireland.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I went to preach humanity to the
Irish Catholics.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then we returned to Wales,
a lovely country.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Harriet’s all right .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
she expects a child.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Have you read
Berkeley? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. At this moment I’m reading
Helvetius .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. very clever, but dry stuff.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg looked at him with the admiration, affection,
and irony, of former days. Who but Shelley
would start off to discuss Helvetius with a friend
from whom he had parted on such bad terms a
year back?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley, full of animation and joy, walked about
the room, opened books, put questions to which he
never waited the answers, and seemed to have forgotten
completely that Hogg had ever offended him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He talked far into the night, and the men in the
chambers next to Hogg knocked furiously on the
walls to warn him that the high and piercing voice
of his visitor prevented them from sleeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg, alarmed for his good name, suggested
Shelley should go. Shelley continued to talk. He
explained that he had just opened a subscription
list to finish a dyke which would enable the Welsh
at Tremadoc to regain 5,000 acres of land from the
sea. He had headed the list with £100 and he
was devoting his life, his strength, and his fortune
to the enterprise.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hogg taking him gently
by the arm led him to the door, but he resisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your neighbours bore me! They are brutes
who don’t understand that it is only during the
night that the soul feels really free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg had managed to get him out upon the
landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go, but on one condition, and that is that
you come and dine with us to-morrow. Harriet
will be delighted to see you. I apologize for having
a horrible creature with us, Miss Hitchener .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
but she will be leaving in a day or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Hitchener? The sister of your soul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>She</span>, the sister of my soul?” cried Shelley.
“She’s a crawling and contemptible worm.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
We call her the Brown Demon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they had now reached the street. Hogg
gently pushed his friend out of the house and
closed the door behind him.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day at six o’clock, Hogg sent in his name
to Harriet. She received him with enthusiasm.
She looked younger, more blooming, and lovelier
than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a separation this has been!” she said.
“But it will not happen again. We are now
going to live in London for ever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliza sat apart in haughty silence. She gave
Hogg a limp hand, without condescending to speak
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re looking delightfully well, Harriet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She? Oh, no, poor dear thing!” said Eliza
in a lackadaisical voice. “Her nerves are in a
fearful state. Most dreadfully shattered!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg thought, “Nothing is changed in this
house, one must take care what one says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley at this moment burst into the room like
a cannon ball, and dinner was brought up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner there were mysterious whisperings
from Eliza into Harriet’s ear, who came obediently
to bid Hogg good night, and to invite him to come
again on Sunday morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the day the Brown Demon is going, conversation
will be so difficult. But you are always
such good fun, you would be the greatest help to
us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Percy has told you about our
Tormentor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the mention of Miss Hitchener’s name Eliza
exhibited a deep but silent disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a horrible woman,” Harriet went on.
“She tried to make Percy fall in love with her.
She pretended that he did really love her, and that
I was only good for the housekeeping. Percy has
promised her £100 a year if only she will go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley confirmed this. He saw the imprudence
of thus sacrificing a quarter of his income, but it
was necessary. The young woman had lost her
situation through him, and her reputation and
health into the bargain, she added, thanks to their
barbarous conduct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is really a horrible creature!” he said
shuddering. “A superficial, ugly, hermaphroditical
beast of a woman. I’ve never been so
astonished at my bad taste as after spending four
months with her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How would Hell be, if
such a woman were in Heaven? And she writes
poetry! She has written an Elegy on the Rights
of Woman, which begins:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“All, all are men, the woman like the rest.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He burst into one of his wild shouts of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day Hogg did not fail to turn up. The
Heroine of the day appeared to him boring but
inoffensive. She was a big, bony, masculine
woman, dark-skinned, and with traces of a beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley presently declared he must go out,
Harriet had a bad headache and needed quiet;
Hogg’s fate was to take the two Eliza’s for a
walk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the Brown Demon on his right arm, and
the Black Diamond, as he nicknamed Eliza Westbrook,
on his left, he directed their steps towards
St. James’s Park. “I could say, like Cornelia:
‘These are my jewels!’ ” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two fair rivals attacked each other across
him in phrases of haughty contempt. The languishing
Eliza woke up to deal formidable blows
with a calm soft acrimony. Miss Hitchener made
a show of speaking only to Hogg. She discoursed
on the Rights of Woman. Eliza who could not
talk on this subject, nor on any other, found herself
reduced to ignominious silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they got home she penned Hogg into a
corner of the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could you talk to that nasty creature
so much? How could you permit her to prate so
long to you? Harriet will be seriously displeased
with you, I assure you! She will be very angry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Harriet merely smiled up at him and asked,
“Were you not tired of the Brown Demon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When luncheon was over he wickedly led the
conversation back to Woman’s Rights, and the
Goddess of Reason was at once let loose. Shelley
rose from his chair, came and stood before her and
fell into animated discussion. The sisters Westbrook
looked at him with sorrowful dismay as at
one guilty of communication with the enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliza whispered to Hogg, “If you only knew
how dirty she is you wouldn’t go near her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the moment of release came when the
exile’s bags and boxes were piled into a hackney-coach,
and the women of Shelley’s household were
left dancing and singing for joy.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVI<br/> <br/> HARRIET</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The few months which followed the departure of
Miss Hitchener were happy months. The Shelleys
were still penniless wanderers, but an immense
interior satisfaction replaced for them money and
home. He had begun a long poem, “Queen
Mab,” and to work at it made life worth living.
Harriet, who was with child, was sunk in an agreeable
torpor, reserving all her strength for creative
purposes, and so amused by and interested in her
own sensations and hopes, as to be quite insensible
to boredom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this period they made short visits to
Wales, and returned a second time to Ireland, but
no longer dabbled in politics. To please Percy,
Harriet began to learn Latin. He taught her on
a method of his own. Discarding grammars he
plunged her straight into Horace and Virgil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While she studied, he went on with his poem or
read history. Godwin had assured him that his
ignorance of history was one great cause of his
errors of judgment, and though he loathed the subject
he set at it courageously. In the evening,
Harriet sang old Irish songs, “Robin Adair,”
and “Kate of Kearney,” or they read the newspapers
together, which at that time were filled
with accounts of the prosecutions of Liberal
writers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often to these unknown comrades, condemned
for their opinions, Shelley would write offering to
pay the fine, but never having ten pounds in hand,
he was obliged to borrow at 400 per cent, in order
to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, it was necessary to go back to
London as Harriet’s time was near. Shelley was
also approaching his twenty-first birthday, an
important date for him, for it seemed possible he
might then come to terms with his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took rooms at Cooke’s Hotel in Albemarle
Street. Eliza, who was with them, looked after
Harriet with exaggerated care. Her fussiness
annoyed Shelley always in favour of letting Nature
have her way. When he was absent Eliza would
prime her sister in matrimonial strategy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s most extraordinary that at twenty-one
years of age Percy can’t find a way of making up
with his father, so that you could be received by
the family, and lead the proper sort of life for a
future baronet’s wife! If you were a little more
skilful and persuasive with him, things would be
very different, I’m sure! You ought to have a
town house of your own, your own silver, your
own carriage; and all that could easily be had if
Percy chose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet was of the same mind. She was a
pretty woman and she knew it, and for a pretty
woman a life without luxury is as hard to bear
as a subordinate position for a clever man. The
street admiration she meets with tells her of her
power, and she knows too that youth’s a stuff
that won’t endure. Just as a strongly armed
nation desires to ensure her place in the sun, before
demobilizing, Woman wishes to exact good terms
from her enemy Man, before resigning herself to
the pacifism of old age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides which Eliza was continually pitying
Harriet, and self-pity comes so naturally to all
of us that the most solid happiness can be shaken
by the compassion of a fool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moved thereunto by Harriet at the instigation
of Eliza, and also by renewed counsel from the
Duke of Norfolk, Shelley decided to write again
to his father. He would not have taken this step
had he not judged it to be both honourable and
necessary. He desired earnestly to see his mother,
and even the Squire seen from a distance of time
and place appeared to him a pathetic and inoffensive
figure.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Father</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I once more presume to address you to
state to you my sincere desire of being considered
as worthy of a restoration to the intercourse with
yourself and my family which I have forfeited by
my follies.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I hope the time is approaching
when we shall consider each other as father
and son with more confidence than ever, and that
I shall no longer be a cause of disunion to the
happiness of my family. I was happy to hear
from John Grove who dined with us yesterday,
that you continue in good health. My wife unites
with me in respectful regards.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately, Timothy Shelley, with characteristic
wrong-headedness, chose a test of
Bysshe’s obedience to which it was impossible for
him to submit; he could not write to the authorities
of University College that he was now a sincere
and dutiful son of the Church. And, failing this,
his father declined all further communication with
him.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not so degraded and miserable a slave,”
wrote Shelley to the Duke of Norfolk, “as publicly
to disavow an opinion which I believe to be true.
Every man of common sense must plainly see that
a sudden renunciation of sentiments seriously
taken up is as unfortunate a test of intellectual
uprightness as can possibly be devised.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
am willing to concede everything that is reasonable,
anything that does not involve a compromise
of that self-esteem without which life would be a
burden and a disgrace.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Eliza considered such obduracy absurd. “Thus
Harriet, so soon to be brought to bed, will not
even have a carriage to save her running about
the streets on foot!” Shelley, exasperated,
bought a carriage on credit, and refused to use it.
He hated being shut up in a closed carriage, and
much preferred long tramps with Hogg on foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though sick to death of Eliza at home, there
were plenty of pleasant houses where he could
take refuge. There was the Godwins’ in Skinner
Street, where Fanny and Jane Clairmont always
received him with open arms. There was the
Newtons’ in Chester Square, where he found
affection, intelligence, and old-world courtesy.
Mrs. Newton, a first-rate musician, the favourite
pupil of Dussek, would sit down to the piano,
while Shelley seated on the rug amidst the children
would tell them tales of ghosts and phantoms in
a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very often Madame de Boinville was on a visit
to her sister. These two ladies, daughters of a
wealthy St. Vincent planter, had received a mixed
Anglo-French education that Shelley, tremendous
admirer of the French philosophers, much appreciated.
Madame de Boinville, in particular,
charmed him. Her romantic marriage with a
ruined <span class='it'>émigré</span>, a friend of André Chénier and of
La Fayette, invested her with a poetic fascination.
She was a woman with white hair, but with so
childlike a face, such speaking eyes, a mind so
lively and up-to-date, that one had more pleasure
in talking with her than with many a younger
woman. For the first time in his life Shelley
found, in her and her sister, women whose intellectuality
was on a par with his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversation of Eliza and Miss Hitchener
now appeared to him thoroughly despicable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From living with Harriet, he had fallen into the
habit of looking on women as children, for whom
an abstract idea must be reduced to its simplest
expression. With Madame de Boinville he was
astonished to find that he could not only tell her
all his ideas, but that by the charm and precision
of her language she gave them a new attraction.
For her and her sister, as for Shelley himself, the
play of thought was the finest of pastimes.
Learning is nothing without cultivated manners,
but when the two are combined in a woman you
have one of the most exquisite products of
civilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a secret joy and a delicious feeling of
attained perfection, Shelley realized that he had at
last found surroundings propitious to his happiness,
and that everything he had previously known
was grotesquely unworthy of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ladies, on their side, were enchanted by
their discovery of Shelley, for this very good-looking
and well-born young man loved ideas as they
did and expressed them with warmth. He had got
rid of the rather intolerant dogmatism of his sixteen
years, and now in discussion showed modesty
and forbearance. Never had they met a man so
selfless, so generous, so free from materialism as
he. Generally serious, he yet was capable of fun,
and he had the ease of manner, the contempt for
ceremony, and the perfect politeness, which is the
hall-mark of the young aristocrat. “What more
charming,” they asked themselves, “than a saint
who is at the same time a man of the world?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a tinge of jealousy, but also with affectionate
interest, Hogg watched the manœuvrings
of all these pretty women round his ingenuous
friend. At the Godwins’ the girls called Shelley
the Elf-King or the King of Faery; at the Newtons’
he was known as Ariel and Oberon. The
moment he appeared the women gathered about
him. But he was a Spirit difficult to call up at
any fixed hour. He was subject to strange
caprices, sudden frights, panic terrors. Sometimes
falling into a poetic vision, he forgot that
he was expected to a tea-party. At other times,
when he was actually caught and supposedly held
fast, all at once some imaginary duty called him
one knew not where.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In certain countries,” Hogg told him, “it is
believed that goats, which are children of the devil,
pass one hour out of every twenty-four in hell.
I think you’re like the goats, Shelley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, when engaged with a woman
after his own heart in one of the serious and
animated talks which he so much enjoyed, he forgot
both time and place. The night waned, and
Adonis still led his rather breathless priestesses
conversationally onwards. Dawn broke; he was
talking still. Then, as it was too late to go to bed,
a walk in the delicious morning air rounded things
off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the devil were you talking about all
night to your circle of beauties?” the puzzled
Hogg would inquire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet also wondered what her husband could
have to say to all these women. She was now
near her term, and seldom went out of doors.
Shelley often left her alone. In the houses where
he was a favourite, she felt that she was unwelcome.
At the Godwins’ she could not get on with
Mrs. Godwin. At the Boinville’s she had been
thought at first charming because she was so
pretty and the wife of a poet, but she was soon set
down as a very ordinary woman.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVII<br/> <br/> COMPARISONS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The child was a girl, fair, with blue eyes. Her
father named her Ianthe. Her mother added
Elizabeth. Thus Ovid and Miss Westbrook
clasped hands over the cradle. Shelley walked
about with the baby in his arms singing to it a
monotonous tune of his own making. The idea of
bringing up a new being that he might save from
prejudices was delightful to him. As an admirer
of Rousseau he expected Harriet to suckle the child
herself and he was eager to give the tenderest care
to both. In the excitement of his new rôle, the
odious Eliza was forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Harriet, egged on by her sister, refused to
nurse the child. She engaged a wet nurse, “a
hireling” as Shelley declared resentfully. But
on this point Harriet was gently but firmly
obstinate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A curious change came over her after Ianthe’s
birth. It seemed as though she wished to make
up for nine months’ inactivity. Her Latin lessons
were not resumed. She wanted nothing now but
to be out of doors looking into the bonnet-shops
and jewellers’ windows. To find pleasure in such
idle trifling seemed to Shelley monstrous and unintelligible.
He was willing to pay for any of
Harriet’s “reasonable” fancies, even at the price
of loans and endless annoyances, but to spend the
money so necessary to “persecuted writers” and
other just causes, on mere “glad rags,” appeared
to him scandalous, and he made his wife and sister-in-law
feel it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliza was careful to show up Shelley’s failings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Percy finds money enough to pay the debts
of his dear Godwin, who plucks him and whose
wife is rude to us. He finds money to pay the
fines for a set of miserable scribblers, but he can’t
afford to dress his own wife decently! He’s a
fool if he thinks it odd that a young and pretty
woman should like bonnets. If you don’t dress
now at eighteen, when <span class='it'>can</span> you do so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Westbrook encouraged at the house the
visits of an army man, a certain Major Ryan,
whom they had first met in Ireland, and now
found again in London. He, too, was of opinion
that so charming a young woman as Harriet ought
to lead a more normal life. Harriet was inclined
to agree with him. Latin and philosophy had
really been a great strain on her. She had borne
it without complaint because of her love and
admiration for Percy. But shopping and gay
chatter were just as much to her taste as were the
Newtons to Shelley’s, and the pleasure she found
in these frivolities contrasted with the rather painful
attention she had given to her “lessons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley thought that town life and its temptations
was the cause of the trouble, and he had the
very natural idea of all lovers who feel a shadow
falling between them, to go back to these scenes
where their love had been unclouded. Harriet’s
famous carriage was got ready. Shelley raised
£500 by a post-obit bond for £2,000, and, accompanied
by the inevitable Eliza, went on pilgrimage
to Keswick and Edinburgh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The constant change of scene on the journey
made them forget their worries, and they returned
to London in much better spirits, but they had
hardly settled down again when the old disagreements
were renewed. Harriet and Eliza pined for
a fine house, fashionable life, gowns, and a social
circle. Shelley detested all these things but
detested still more the idea that his wife wanted
them. He still loved her, but he began to feel a
touch of contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg came to see them. He found Harriet
quite recovered, prettier and more blooming than
ever. But she no longer offered to read to him the
wise counsels of Idomeneus. She asked him
instead to go with her to her milliner’s. She
vanished into the shop, leaving him waiting on
the pavement. She began to bore him, and as a
man has little indulgence towards the woman who
has rejected his advances he let Shelley see it.
Shelley, too, could no longer hide his impatience.
The Shelleys had reached the dangerous moment
of confidences with a third person.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Madame de Boinville invited Shelley and
Hogg to pass a few days with her in the country,
they accepted with joy. They found there her
daughter Cornelia, who was cultured, pensive and
pretty, and her sister Mrs. Newton. Shelley again
knew the delightful sensations of former evenings
passed with them in town. He called Madame de
Boinville, Maimouna, because she reminded him of
the heroine of <span class='it'>Thalaba</span> whose</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. face was as a damsel’s face</p>
<p class='line'>And yet her hair was grey.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The attractive Cornelia gave the two young men
lessons in Italian, and Madame de Boinville
expounded in her delicious voice the indulgent
teaching of the French philosophers. “To enjoy
life, and help others to enjoy it, without harming
anyone, herein lies the whole of morality.” This
dictum of Chamfort’s, which was a great favourite
of Madame de Boinville, ought by rights to have
roused Shelley’s wrath. Poor Harriet had never
said anything so flatly opposed to virtue.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But then she would have said it much less well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Bracknell even fooling seemed pleasant to
Shelley, because there the simplest games were
imbued with the cast of thought. Cornelia had
the habit, when she first woke up, of reading over
and often learning by heart, one of Petrarch’s
sonnets. This sonnet she thought over and fed
upon all day long. When they said good morning
to her, Shelley and Hogg would inquire which the
day’s sonnet might be. Sometimes the poem was
so moving she did not trust herself to recite it, but
opened the little pocket Petrarch always carried
with her, and pointed out the passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walking between the two young men in the
garden, she would comment the love text with
eloquence and simplicity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is so good to begin the day,” she said,
“with a draught of tenderness which sweetens all
our thoughts, words and deeds until the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These walks, these talks, seemed to Shelley the
only things of any real importance. The house, fine
yet simple, charmed him by its perfection and the
absence of the luxury which disgusted him so
much. It was for him a place of repose and of
freedom from care. Harriet was invited to join
them. Madame de Boinville received her with
kindness. “She’s a very pretty little creature,”
she told Hogg. “But she seems to me a rather
frivolous companion for our dear, delightful Stoic.
However, she’s not yet eighteen, I think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet, unfortunately, saw quite well that she
was not treated on a footing of equality. She
saw that Percy took far more pleasure in reading
Petrarch with Cornelia than in discussing with his
wife how to improve their style of living; and by
a reaction against an environment which she dimly
felt to be hostile to her in spite of an appearance
of cordiality, she put on cold and ironical airs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the rest of the party were solemnly debating
on Virtue, or the Reform Bill, Shelley saw her
exchange mocking smiles with Hogg and Peacock,
a new and very sceptical friend they had just
discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could forgive Hogg’s irony. His wife’s
irritated him. Hogg’s mind was an entirely
different world from his, and he permitted the
difference. But Harriet’s mind was his very own
handiwork. He had formed it, trained it, cultivated
it. He was accustomed to think of it as his
echo. On suddenly discovering that this other
self had detached itself from him, and could sometimes
even make fun of what he said, he was surprised
and profoundly hurt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is nothing which makes a woman appear
stupider than secret jealousy. Instead of attacking
the foe openly, which would be natural and
pathetic, she criticizes with spite innocent
words and inoffensive actions, and showing a
terrible want of tact gives an air of meanness to
a sentiment which is perfectly justifiable. Harriet
found fault with everything at Bracknell because
she had good cause to be jealous of Cornelia
Turner. But Shelley, who put down her scornful
looks and her mocking remarks to an incredible
childishness, treated her with cool contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this her pride was up in arms, and her
behaviour became worse. “Eliza is right,” she
thought, “Percy is absolutely selfish, and thinks
everything he does is perfect. Because he likes
this dull life, these silly discussions, and this
Italian poetry, he wants to force me to like them
too. But what right has he to prevent me from
living <span class='it'>my</span> life? How is Cornelia Turner reading
Petrarch so superior to me? These women whom
he admires are neither so young nor so good-looking
as I. He would very soon want me
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this idea in her head she announced her
intention of returning to London to join Eliza.
Her hostesses did nothing to dissuade her, beyond
the few words of regret which politeness requires.
“Poor Shelley,” these ladies remarked, just as
the Godwin girls had done, “he has not got the
wife he ought to have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet fell into the way of going up to stay
with Eliza for weeks at a time, leaving her husband
alone at Bracknell. Soon the usual “kind
friend” let Shelley know that his wife was going
about with Major Ryan. For the first time since
his marriage the idea of a possible infidelity
occurred to him. It was a question which in the
abstract he had always treated with the greatest
contempt. Suddenly brought up against it with
Harriet and himself as possible actors, he was
overwhelmed with the most violent grief he had
yet known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reason told him he ought to consider himself
lucky if he were freed from a very ordinary
woman. If at that moment he loved at all, was
it not rather the heavenly Cornelia than Harriet
whose miserable spite had recently annoyed him
so much? And, if he no longer loved her, to
break with her would be best. He had always
taught that when passion’s trance is over-past
each should be free again. But it was in vain
that he reasoned thus with himself. He discovered
with stupefaction that Percy Shelley and Harriet
Westbrook were no longer two separate and free
beings. The sum of past memories, caresses, joys,
and sufferings enmeshed them both in a web from
which there was no escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rushed up to town, determined either to
offer Harriet his excuses or to confess his faults.
But she received him with harshness and irony.
Any heart-to-heart talk was out of the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His child-wife, so gentle and submissive only
three months ago, now showed herself cold and
haughty. How had such a change come about?
There were instants when Shelley thought he
detected, beneath pride’s hard surface, a fleeting
image of the other Harriet, but when he sought
to hold it by a loving word, it was gone. Against
the steely armour of her heart he knocked in
vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wandering about the streets without any
object, he thought: “What a fool I have been!
Here I am tied for ever to a woman who does
not love me, who has never loved me. Evidently
she only married me for the money and title.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now that she sees her hopes upset, she
punishes me for her mistake.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” And he
repeated with disgust: “A heart of ice .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a
lump of ice!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps had he ever seen her alone he would
have succeeded in thawing it, but Eliza, prim,
hostile, formidable, stood always between them,
and the gallant Major Ryan was in the wings,
ready to commiserate the cruelties of a doctrinaire
husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After struggling for a few days, Shelley’s
ardour was suddenly quenched. Capable by fits
and starts of an energy when nothing was impossible
to him, he fell as formerly after his long
tramps at Oxford into an insurmountable torpor,
and his will-power like a dying candle-flame threw
up a final blaze of light before it expired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he saw that Harriet was obdurate, he
gave up all hope of saving the remnants of his
married happiness, and he wrote to Bracknell to
announce he was coming on a month’s visit, and
coming alone. He knew well that after a month’s
interval he would find Harriet completely ruined
by her hateful surroundings, he knew that a
catastrophe would be the result of the Bracknell
interlude, but he was too tired to carry on the
fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What more am I now but an insect warming
itself in a ray of sunshine? The next cloud
that passes will plunge me into the frozen darkness
of death.” And, in melancholy mood, he
recited the lines from Burns:</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“But pleasures are like poppies spread,</p>
<p class='line'>You seize the flow’r, its bloom is shed;</p>
<p class='line'>Or like the snow-fall in the river,</p>
<p class='line'>A moment white, then melts for ever.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to him that into the translucent
domes of crystal wherein his fancy dwelt, Harriet,
Ianthe and Elizabeth had been suddenly flung like
so many blocks of living and rebellious matter.
In vain did he try with all the forces of logic to
drag them out. His feeble weapons were crushed
beneath the ponderous reality.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVIII<br/> <br/> SECOND INCARNATION OF THE GODDESS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>There were days when Shelley, recalling the sweet
and childlike face of his eighteen-year-old wife,
thought it might still be possible to forget and
make up. In a pathetic poem he tried to tell her
how miserable it was for one who had lived in the
warm sunshine of her eyes to die beneath her
scorn. Did the lines move her? He never knew.
She shut herself up more and more in feelings of
pride and revenge. He had left her on several
occasions. No doubt it was as a reprisal that the
moment he came back to London she set off with
Ianthe for Bath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley was obliged to remain in town. He had
come of age, yet his affairs were no further
advanced thereby. His solicitor gave him to
understand there might be a family law-suit to
deprive him of his rights. Although crippled with
debts himself, he persisted in trying to free others
from theirs. The Juvenile Library founded by
Godwin had been a failure, and the sight of this
old fighter for justice, impoverished and saddened
by money troubles, was inexpressibly painful to
his young disciple and friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But three thousand pounds were needed to save
Godwin, a big sum. Yet from the moment he
knew of Shelley’s wish to save him, he again
exhibited great friendliness, and as Shelley was
now a “bachelor” in London, his “beauteous
half” being in the country for an indefinite period,
he was invited to dine in Skinner Street every
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He accepted all the more readily that he wished
to see the girls again, and Godwin had informed
him he would find an extra one, Mary, who had
at length come home from Scotland. He gave
an attractive portrait of her; seventeen years old,
quick and lively, a great wish to learn, and
immense perseverance. Already Fanny and Jane
had described her to Shelley as being as intelligent
as she was beautiful. For her mother, Mary
Wollstonecraft, Shelley had the warmest admiration.
He was greatly moved at the thought he
was about to meet her unknown daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He needed for his happiness to embody in the
form of a beautiful woman the mysterious and
benevolent Forces which he imagined as scattered
throughout the Universe. Love was, for him, an
impassioned admiration, an integral act of faith,
an exquisite and perfect mixture of the sensuous
and the intellectual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had Mary not appeared at that juncture, or had
she proved a disappointment, the sentiment which
hovered and hesitated in his wounded heart, would
have dedicated itself to Fanny or to Jane, but
Mary came, and his fate was settled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face was very pale and pure, her golden
hair arranged in smooth bands on either side of
a shapely head, she had a great slab of a forehead,
and earnest hazel eyes. An air of sensibility
and mournful courage instantly inspired in
Shelley the same enthusiasm that he found in reading
Homer or Plutarch. He saw something heroic
in this delicate young girl, and the mixture of the
heroic and the feminine was ever that which most
appealed to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What seriousness and what feeling!” thought
he, listening with ecstasy to her young fresh voice.
A maiden standing where brook and river meet,
having the grace of the woman and the intellectual
eagerness of the youth, had always seemed to
him one of the most exquisite works of art. He
longed to put a brotherly arm round those slender
shoulders, and to make those questioning eyes
sparkle, as he bore her away on some astonishing
gallop through the realms of aërial metaphysics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet Westbrook had only imperfectly
realized his ideal. For a moment he had hoped
to find in her the delightful blend of beauty and
intelligence that he would so greatly have loved,
but poor Harriet had not withstood the difficult
test of time. She was wanting in any real brain-power;
even when she had the air of being
interested in ideas, her indifference was proved by
the blankness of her gaze. Worst of all, she was
coquettish, frivolous, versed in the tricks and
wiles of woman, and this alone was sufficient
to chill him to the marrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mary, of the nut-brown eyes, was slim and
true as a Toledo blade. Brought up by the
author of <span class='it'>Political Justice</span>, her mind appeared free
from all feminine superstition; and the clear
if rather piercing tones of her voice emphasized
delightfully its cultivated precision. Dining every
evening in the little house in Skinner Street,
Shelley passed the time in looking at Mary, while
he seemed to listen to Godwin, who explained the
regrettable state of his own affairs, and discussed
the Budget, or the laws of the Press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary, on her side, was quite ready to fall in
love with Shelley. The romance had been prepared
by the sisters, who for a month previously
had talked of nothing in their letters but the handsome
poet. Yet no description of Shelley ever
came up to the reality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary saw, at once, how much she interested
him. Although he had made no complaint of
life—he never did—she realized he was unhappy,
and so one evening when they found themselves
alone in the room where her mother’s portrait
hung she spoke to him of her own troubles. She
adored her father, but detested Mrs. Godwin on
whose account the home in Skinner Street was
become odious to her. The only place in the
world where she felt herself at peace was by her
mother’s tomb in the churchyard of old St.
Pancras. She went there book in hand every fine
day to read and meditate. Shelley, thrilled, asked
if he might go with her.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, after an interval of five years, he found
himself sitting again at a young girl’s side in a
graveyard, but this time his companion was of
a serious and impassioned soul. For the second
time the Word was made Woman. But, alas,
Shelley was no longer free. He felt himself
drawn to Mary by an irresistible force. He longed
to take her hand, to press his lips to her delicately
curved ones, he knew that she desired him, as he
did her, and they dared not let their eyes meet.
What could he offer her? He was a married man.
It is true that marriage is only a convention.
When one loves no longer, one is free. He had
never promised Harriet more than this; besides,
believing her to be the mistress of Major Ryan, he
felt no scruples on her account. But his marriage
was legally indissoluble. He had nothing to offer
Mary but that reprobate existence which he had
not dared to impose on his first love, Harriet
Grove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, a love shared, even though hopeless,
is better than uncertainty and moral isolation.
He determined to tell Mary the whole truth about
his wife. Married love, even as it dies, long holds
out behind a mask of silence against the world’s
assaults, but there comes a moment when a man
finds a bitter joy in laying bare his wounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley drew a picture of Harriet as he now
saw her, and by an unconscious change of values
lent, to his very human deception, motives of a
spiritual order. He had needed a companion who
could appreciate poetry and understand philosophy.
Harriet was incapable of either. He took a painful
pleasure, also very human, in depreciating the
grapes which he had lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave Mary a copy of <span class='it'>Queen Mab</span>. Under
the printed dedication of that poem to Harriet,
he wrote the words, “Count Slobendorf was
about to marry a woman who, attracted solely by
his fortune, proved her selfishness by deserting
him in prison.” Back in her own room, Mary
added, “This book is sacred to me, and as no
other creature shall ever look into it, I may write
in it what I please—yet what shall I write—that I
love the author beyond all powers of expression
and that I am parted from him, dearest and only
love—by that love we have promised to each other
although I may not be yours, I can never be
another’s. But I am thine, exclusively thine.</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>‘By the kiss of love, the glance none saw beside,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The smile none else might understand,</p>
<p class='line'>The whispered thought of hearts allied,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;The pressure of the thrilling hand.’</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>“I have pledged myself to thee and sacred is the
gift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, these glances and smiles that none
might see nor understand, had been seen and perfectly
understood by Godwin. The intrigue of his
daughter with a married man troubled him. He
pointed out the danger to her, and wrote to Shelley
in the same strain. He advised him to make
things up with his wife: and he begged him to discontinue,
for the present, his visits to Skinner
Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prohibition, kindly as it was, simply
hastened on events, which, without it, might have
tarried. Shelley, passionately in love with Mary
and deprived of her society, determined to take
a decisive step. He felt no remorse on Harriet’s
account, for he persisted in thinking her guilty, in
spite of the assertions of Peacock and Hogg, both
impartial witnesses. “There’s just one thing
only she cares about,” he thought, “and that is
money. I’ll provide for her future, and then she’ll
be glad to be free.” Accordingly he wrote to her
begging her to come to London. She came; she
was four months gone with child, and very unwell.
When, calmly and kindly, Percy told her he was
going to live without her and elope with some one
else, but that he would always remain her best
friend, the shock brought on an alarming illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley nursed her with devotion, which made
her more unhappy still, and the moment she was
better he resumed his inflexible arguments. “The
union of the sexes is sacred only so long as it contributes
to the happiness of husband and wife, and
it is dissolved automatically from the moment that
its evils exceed its benefits. Constancy has
nothing virtuous in itself, on the contrary it is
often vicious, leading one to condone the gravest
faults in the object of one’s choice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he wove round her these diaphanous but
insuperable webs, Harriet knew she was lost, just
as formerly when she had tried to defend her
religious beliefs against him she had seen herself
overwhelmed on every side. She knew that some
answer <span class='it'>must</span> exist; that so much anguish and
sorrow and horror should find some expression,
and might have found it had her mind been
clearer; as it was she never knew what she ought
to say. She dreamed she was struggling to free
herself from invisible bonds. Her one relief was in
terrible outbursts of rage against Mary. It was
she who was the cause of all, she who had separated
Percy from his wife, taking advantage of his
romantic tendencies to entice him to meet her at
a grave-side, which was just the kind of thing that
would appeal to him. She had made a shameful
use of her mother’s memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary, on her side, had not the slightest pity for
Harriet. She had formed an odious conception of
her. A woman who, having had the felicity of
marrying Shelley, had yet been incapable of making
him happy could only be selfish, futile, second-rate.
She knew that he would treat Harriet with
generosity, that he was going to give an order to
his banker to pay over to her the greater part of
his allowance, and this knowledge quieted her conscience.
“She’ll have the money, and that’s all
she cares about,” Mary said with disdain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley was in a condition of extreme nervous
agitation. All sorts of contrary sentiments warred
in his soul. When he saw Harriet fall into heartbreaking
fits of despair, he could not forget the
delicious moments passed with her long ago, but
he had only to be again in Mary’s presence to
consecrate himself anew to her tranquil charm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To calm his mind he began to take laudanum
as he had formerly done at Berwick, but now in
stronger doses. He showed the bottle to Peacock,
and said: “I never part from this.” He added,
“I am always repeating to myself your lines from
Sophocles:</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='pindent'>The post-chaise was ordered for four o’clock in
the morning. Shelley waited up all night opposite
Godwins’ house. At length he saw the stars and
the oil-lamps grow pale. Mary noiselessly opened
the hall door. Jane Clairmont, who at the last
moment had decided to go with her sister, looked
after the luggage with zeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The long carriage journey greatly tired Mary,
but Shelley dared not stop lest Godwin were pursuing
them. At about four in the afternoon they
reached Dover, where after the usual difficulties
with custom-house officials, and sailors, they found
a small boat which agreed to take them over to
Calais.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weather was fine. The white cliffs of
Albion slowly faded away. The fugitives were
safe. Presently the wind rose and freshened into
a gale. Mary, very ill, passed the night lying
upon Shelley’s knees, who, himself worn out with
fatigue, supported her head on his shoulder. The
moon sunk to a stormy horizon; then, in total
darkness, a thunderstorm struck the sail, and the
fast-flashing lightning revealed a dark and swollen
sea. When morning broke the storm passed, the
wind changed, and the sun rose broad, and red,
and cloudless, over France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary shook off her somnolence in the streets of
Calais; the gay bustle of the harbour, the picturesque
costume of the fisherfolk, the confused
buzz of voices speaking a strange language,
revived her. The day was spent at the inn, as
they had to wait for the luggage coming by the
Dover Packet, but when this arrived it brought
also Mrs. Godwin and her green spectacles. The
fat lady hoped to persuade Jane, at least, to go
back with her to Skinner Street, but Shelley’s
eloquence won the day, and Mrs. Godwin returned
alone. At six o’clock the travellers left Calais for
Boulogne in a cabriolet drawn by three horses running
abreast.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their plan was to get to Switzerland, but after
a few days in Paris their purse was empty.
Shelley had a letter for a certain Tavernier, a
French man of business, who was to act as banker
for them. They invited him to lunch at the hotel,
and put him down as a perfect idiot, for he seemed
to have a difficulty in understanding the absolute
necessity of this journey by two little girls, and a
tall and excitable young man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley had to pawn his watch and chain; he
got eight napoleons for them. This would give
them bread and cheese for a fortnight, so with
minds at ease, they began to explore the Boulevards,
the Louvre, and Notre Dame. Later on
they preferred to remain in the hotel and re-read
together the works of Mary Wollstonecraft and
Byron’s poems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the week, Tavernier, a good
fellow in the main, agreed to lend them sixty
pounds. But, as this was not enough to pay for
their places by diligence, they decided to start on
foot, and to buy an ass to carry the luggage, and
each of them ride it by turns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley went to the cattle-market and came back
to the hotel with a very small donkey. Next
morning a hackney-coach took them to the Barrier
of Charenton, the ass trotting behind the carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The roads in France in the year 1814 were not
particularly safe. The armies had just been
demobilized, and bands of marauders robbed those
who travelled on them. The peasants working in
the fields by the road-side stared with all their eyes
at this extraordinary caravan of two pretty girls
in black silk gowns, a stripling with curly hair,
and a ridiculously small donkey. At the end of a
few miles, the last appeared so tired that Shelley
and Jane had to carry him! In the village where
they slept they sold him to a peasant and bought
a mule in his place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole of the district had been devastated
by the war, the villages were half-destroyed, the
houses mostly roofless with fire-blackened beams;
if they asked a farmer for milk he replied by cursing
the Cossacks who had carried off his cows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the wretched inns the beds were so dirty
that Mary and Jane dared not use them. Enormous
rats brushed by them in the darkness.
They fell into the habit of sitting up all night in
the farm-kitchens. The big stove, still alight, made
the atmosphere heavy, and between sleeping and
waking, the crying of children and the creakings
of the old woodwork were woven into their dreams.
Mary thought of her father, and wondered was he
suffering terribly from her flight? Shelley was
preoccupied with the fate of Harriet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Troyes he wrote her a long letter, urging
her to come out and join them in Switzerland. She
should live near them, and there, at least, find one
firm and constant friend. He gave her news of
Mary’s health, which appeared to him a natural
thing to do, and he felt quite sure that Harriet
would very soon be with them. Maybe, the
“world” would think this life in common
immoral, but why trouble about “the world’s”
opinion? Was it not better to obey the dictates of
love and kindness than those of absurd prejudices?
Harriet made no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going by Pontarlier and Neufchâtel they reached
the Lake of the Four Cantons. Shelley wished to
settle at Brunnen, near the Chapel of William Tell,
the Defender of Liberty. The only empty house
in the place was an old château, deserted, and falling
into ruin. They hired two rooms in it for six
months, and bought furniture, beds, chairs, wardrobes,
and a stove. The curé and the village
doctor came to call upon the new-comers, and on
the same day Shelley began to write a great novel,
<span class='it'>The Assassins</span>. They had settled down “for
ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the new stove refused to draw, and Shelley
who was not clever with his fingers, tinkered at it
in vain. The room was glacial and filled with
smoke. Outside the rain beat against the
windows. The three young exiles found themselves
desperately lonely. They recalled the comfort
of their English houses, English tea, hot and
scented, England’s mild sky, the cool, good-natured
Englishmen speaking their language and
able to pronounce their names. Even the English
usurers, though of course rapacious, were always
courteous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley counted up the common purse. There
remained just twenty-eight pounds. The same
eager desire rose in all three, which Shelley
expressed by the words “Let’s go home!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner said than the decision was taken, and
their spirits rose. “Most laughable to think,”
writes Jane, “of our going to England the second
day after entering a new house for six months, and
all because the stove don’t suit! As we left
Dover, and England’s white cliffs disappeared, I
thought I should never see them again, and
now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Having made up their minds at midnight,
the next morning, in driving rain, they took
a boat to Lucerne. Great was the surprise of
Brunnen’s curé when he learnt that they were
gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Lucerne they reached Bale by passenger-boat
and thence on to Cologne. The weather was
delightful. Beneath the evening stars, the boatmen
chanted love-songs. Shelley worked at <span class='it'>The
Assassins</span>. Mary and Jane had each started a
novel too, and the hills crowned with ruins on
either side gave them a good background for the
romantic adventures of their heroes. Then the
Dutch mail-coach carried them through a sleepy
land of comfortable wooden houses, canals, and
windmills. When they reached Rotterdam they
were again penniless. After long discussion, a
ship’s captain agreed to take them aboard. The
sea was as rough as on the day of their departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley employed his time arguing the question
of slavery with one of the passengers. Mary and
Jane backed him up with warmth. They did not
know in the least if they would have anything to
eat the next day, but they did know that Percy
was a genius, and that Man is perfectible.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span><h1>CHAPTER XX<br/> <br/> THE PARIAHS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>On arriving in London, Shelley could not pay the
cab fare, so with Mary, Jane, and the trunks, he
drove round to his bankers, merely to learn that
Harriet had withdrawn the entire balance to his
credit. At this news the two girls were highly
indignant. The only way to get out of the scrape,
and avoid the police-station, was to go and see
Harriet herself. Shelley had her address, and
thither they now drove. Harriet thought at first
that her husband had come back to her, and was
very indignant, in her turn, when she knew that
her rival was waiting below at the door. However,
she lent Shelley a few pounds, which enabled
the three wanderers to take furnished lodgings in
a mean street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Things looked black. Godwin absolutely
refused to see them. Shelley pleaded that he had
given a practical application to the principles of
<span class='it'>Political Justice</span>, but this merely exasperated the
author of the treatise still more. <span class='it'>Political Justice</span>
was in his eyes a theoretical work, the principles of
which might be excellent in some Utopia—although
it was also very long since he had written
it—but in London in the midst of a pitiless society,
in his own house, to expose Godwin and his only
daughter to the scorn of his friends, thus to pervert
his teaching .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, he would never forgive
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he mentioned the adventure it was in the
most severe terms. Writing to a Mr. John Taylor
of Norwich, he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a story to tell you of the deepest
melancholy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You are already acquainted
with the name of Shelley.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Not to keep you
longer in suspense, he, a married man, has run
away with my daughter. I cannot conceive of an
event of more accumulated horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary, my only daughter, was absent in Scotland
for her health, and returned to me on the
30th of March last. Shelley came to London on
the 18th June and I invited him to take his meals
at my house. On Sunday, June 26th, he accompanied
Mary and her sister, Jane Clairmont, to the
tomb of Mary’s mother, and there it seems the
impious idea first occurred to him of seducing
her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He had the madness to disclose his
plans to me and to ask my consent. I expostulated
with him with all the energy of which I was
master.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I seemed to have succeeded, but in
the night of the 27th July, Mary and her sister
Jane escaped from my house, and the next morning
when I rose I found a letter on my dressing
table informing me what they had done.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He begs Taylor to preserve the utmost secrecy
about the affair, so that no stigma may be attached
to the names of these unfortunate girls, and goes
on: “When I use the word stigma I am sure it
is wholly unnecessary to say that I apply it in a
very different sense to the two girls. Jane has
been guilty of an indiscretion only .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mary has
been guilty of a crime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Shelley, in former days, had borrowed large
sums to lend to Mary’s father, and on this account
the bailiffs, so soon as they heard of his return,
had begun to dun him. Godwin not only was
unable to repay Shelley, but had fresh need of
money himself, and it was these financial questions
which compelled him, most reluctantly, to continue
a correspondence with a depraved and perfidious
young man. His conscience suffered greatly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
or at least he said it did in every letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much hypocrisy in a man they had so
venerated, was grievous to Mary and Shelley.
“Oh, philosophy!” they said, and sighed. As to
Mrs. Godwin, she reproached them above all with
corrupting her daughter, and she forbade the
gentle Fanny to visit them. She herself went to
see Jane once, but meeting Shelley on the stairs
she turned away her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their intercourse with Harriet was sometimes
easy, sometimes difficult, according to her changes
of mood. She wanted for nothing, having still
some of Shelley’s money, besides receiving an
allowance from the old tavern-keeper, but she was
with child and very unhappy. She passed her days
in telling her story to the gossips of the neighbourhood,
or in writing in pathetic phrases to her
friend Catherine Nugent, the Dublin dressmaker:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Every age has its cares. God knows I have
mine. Dear Ianthe is quite well. She is fourteen
months old and has six teeth. What I
should have done without this dear babe and my
sister I know not. This world is a scene of
heavy trials to us all. I little expected ever to
go thro’ what I have. But time heals the deepest
wounds, and for the sake of that sweet infant
I hope to live many years. Write to me often.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Tell me how you are in health. Do not despond,
though I see nothing to hope for when all that
was virtuous becomes vicious and depraved. So it
is—nothing is certain in this world. I suppose
there is another, where those that have suffered
keenly here will be happy. Tell me what you
think of this. My sister is with me. I wish you
knew her as well as I do. She is worthy of your
love. Adieu, dear friend, may you still be happy
is the first wish of your ever-faithful friend,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“<span class='sc'>H. Shelley</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ianthe is well and very engaging.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes she was full of hope. Her friends
told her that love affairs of this sort were short-lived
and that her husband would come back to
her. Then she felt gay and wrote Shelley friendly
letters. She was sure that it was Mary who had
made all the mischief: that she had seduced Percy
by telling him extravagant tales: that in reality
he was good, that he would never desert her and
his two children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At other times she had fits of depression and
rage. Then she did all she knew to make the life
of the hated couple more difficult still. She ran
into debt, and sent the creditors to Shelley. She
declared that he was living in promiscuity with
two of Godwin’s daughters. She found out
Godwin’s creditors in order to urge them to
be pitiless, and Mary, who had never seen her,
would say with a sigh: “That frightful woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day in November, Harriet was in a state
of discomfort and pain, and imagined herself very
ill. Her first thought at such moments was always
to call her husband. She sent for Shelley during
the night and he came at once. Without again
becoming the lover, he would have liked to remain
her most devoted friend. But, not understanding
the shade of difference, the moment he showed
attention, she grew fond. Then he checked her
with gentle firmness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of November, she gave birth to a
boy, an eight-months’ child. It brought about no
reconciliation. Shelley doubted if the child was his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Mary, in spite of their misfortunes, he
was deliciously happy. They shared the same
tastes, and both looked upon Life as an opportunity
for learning prolonged into old age. They
read the same books and often aloud. She went
with him in his visits to his lawyers, or the
sheriff’s officers. When he amused himself by
the Serpentine, just as he used to do at Oxford,
in launching a paper flotilla, Mary, sitting beside
him, fashioned the boats with tireless fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under his direction, she set herself to learn
Latin and even Greek. More cultured than
Harriet, she did not see in these studies, as did
the first Mrs. Shelley, a rather boring game, but
an extension of her enjoyment. The greatest
charm of literary culture is that it humanizes love.
Catullus, Theocritus, and Petrarch united to render
more exquisite our lovers’ kisses. Shelley, watching
his new companion at work, was filled with
admiration for her strength of character, and was
delighted to consider her as much superior to
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only shadow, and that a light one, was the
presence of Jane, or rather of Claire, for, having
decided that her name was ugly, she had changed
it for another which was more to her taste. A
brilliant and beautiful girl, she suffered from nerves
and was terribly susceptible. Nothing was worse
for her than to live in close contact with an
amorous young couple. She had a passionate
admiration for Percy, and showed it a little too
plainly. Mary complained, but Shelley could not
agree that there was anything in the sentiment
either disagreeable or shocking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hated being alone, so when Mary, who was
expecting a child, had to give up walks and late
hours he took Claire with him to the lawyers, the
bailiffs, and the banks of the Serpentine, and every
day he begged her to pass the evening with him.
He talked to her of Harriet, of Miss Hitchener, and
of his sisters. He had always loved confidential
talks, and long analyses of thought; sincerity
appeared to him easy with Claire because she was
not his mistress. But Mary could not conceal
her impatience, and Claire, vexed by her sister’s
reproaches, remained silent and gloomy a whole
day through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evening when Mary had gone to bed,
Shelley undertook to pacify Claire. Cleverly and
patiently he explained until midnight the somewhat
complicated sentiments of their little group.
Such was his gentle kindness that Claire ceased to
sulk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve suffered so much!” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Imaginary sufferings, my dear Claire! You
misunderstand words and gestures to which Mary
attaches no importance whatever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the same, I have really suffered, but how
I like good, kind, explaining people!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley went up to repeat the conversation to
Mary. In the room overhead they heard Claire
talking and walking in her sleep. Presently she
came down, she was feeling terribly nervous, and
could not remain alone. Mary took her into her
own bed, and Shelley went to sleep upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This little scene with slight variations was often
repeated. Claire’s nervousness was communicated
to Shelley. Having talked of ghosts and hobgoblins
the greater part of the night, they ended
by frightening each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter with you, Claire? You’re
deathly pale.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Your eyes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No! Don’t
look at me like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, too, Percy, you look strange .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
air is heavy, full of monsters .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. don’t let us
stay here any longer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said good night and went to their rooms,
but almost immediately after, Shelley and Mary
heard a loud cry; somebody tumbled down the
stairs, and Claire, with disordered features, came
to relate that her pillow had been pulled from
under her head by an invisible hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley listened to the tale with terrified
interest, but Mary shrugged her shoulders. If
only this crazy girl would take herself off!</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>The outcasts saw few friends. The Boinville-Newton
set, despite their broad-minded French
philosophy, had turned a cold shoulder when they
were told by Shelley of his new life. With them,
as with Godwin, actions did not run on all fours
with speech, and indulgence in theory allied itself
for some mysterious reason with inclemency in
practice. On the other hand, it was the sceptical
Hogg and Peacock who came at the first call.
They believed in the innocence of Harriet, and did
not approve of Shelley’s conduct, but they were
full of human interest, and looked upon the
passion of love as a somewhat comic disease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley had invited Hogg with misgivings. He
was afraid such a cynic would not please the two
girls. Nor was Mary’s first impression favourable.
“He’s amusing enough when he jokes,”
she said, “but the moment he treats of a serious
subject, one sees that his point of view is
altogether wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogg, in fact, became every day more British
and conservative, singing the praises of tradition,
sport, Public Schools, and naming the best port-wine
years. But finding Mary very pretty and
intelligent, he told Shelley so, who repeated it
to her. On Hogg’s next visit she thought him
much more sympathetic. No doubt he spoke of
virtue as a blind man does of colours; in this
family of enthusiastic “souls” he was the
“hardened sinner”; but his charm was acknowledged.
Mary thought his coldness a cloak, and
that he was better than he appeared. He was
afraid to be sincere with himself or to delve deep,
which would have driven him to forgo so many
things that he liked, but he was really too intelligent
not to feel the weakness of his position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being both good-natured and cultivated, he was
ready to give a helping hand to Mary and Claire
in translating Ovid or Anacreon, when their usual
master had mysteriously vanished. He also
accompanied the ladies to their bonnet-maker
without grumbling, for they, too, visited bonnet-shops
just like poor Harriet, although they went
in quite another frame of mind. If she bought
bonnets with rapture, Mary bought them with a
lofty condescension, so that Shelley did not even
have to excuse in her a concession to fashion which
she herself was the first to deplore.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXI<br/> <br/> GODWIN</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The lodging-house servant brought up a letter
from a lady who was waiting on the opposite pavement.
It was from Fanny, to warn Shelley that
his creditors were plotting to have him arrested.
He and Mary ran down to the street, but, on seeing
them, Fanny hastened away. She was in
terror of Godwin who had forbidden all communication
with the outcasts, and she, perhaps, had
cared too much for Percy to wish to see him again
now that he belonged to her sister. But, being a
swift runner, he soon caught up with her. She
told him the bailiffs were looking for him, that it
was his publisher who had given them his address,
and that Godwin wouldn’t lift a finger to save him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not having money to free himself, the only
thing he could do was to disappear. He decided
to find another lodging while Mary and Claire
should remain quietly where they were, so as to
trick the enemy. Thus, for the first time, the
lovers had to separate, a separation which seemed
terrible to both. They were forced to make
appointments in out-of-the-way taverns, to take a
few stealthy kisses, and to part immediately, lest
Mary might be followed. On Sundays, when
arrests are illegal, they remained together till
midnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening the courage to separate failed
them, and Mary followed Shelley into a miserable
hotel. The landlord looked with a suspicious eye
on this couple who had no luggage, and refused
to serve them with a meal unless they paid him
in advance. Shelley sent round to Peacock, and
while waiting for the money took out the pocket
Shakespeare he always carried, and read aloud to
Mary <span class='it'>Troilus and Cressida</span>. It made them forget
their hunger a whole day through. Next morning
at breakfast-time Peacock, penniless himself, sent
them some cakes. If life was difficult there was
joy in suffering together. Love and misfortune
made a happy pair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they were apart, waiting for night-time,
they sent each other by a confidential
messenger, tender little notes, scribbled in haste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! my dearest love,” wrote Shelley, “why
are our pleasures so short and so interrupted?
How long is this to last? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Meet me to-morrow
at three o’clock in St. Paul’s if you do
not hear before. Adieu: remember love at
vespers before sleep. I do not omit <span class='it'>my</span> prayers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, my love,” replied Mary, “to-morrow
I will seal this blessing on your lips.
Dear good creature, press me to you, and hug
your own Mary to your heart. Perhaps she will
one day have a father: till then be everything to
me, love, and indeed I will be a good girl and never
vex you. I will learn Greek and—but when shall
we meet when I may tell you all this, and you will
so sweetly reward me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In January, 1815, this trying existence was
brought to an end by an event they had long
expected without desiring it, but which they also
accepted without any hypocritical regret. Old Sir
Bysshe died at the age of eighty-three. Timothy
Shelley became second baronet, and Percy the
direct heir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He set out for his father’s house, accompanied
by Claire, who was in a state of great excitement
and eager curiosity. Sir Timothy, puffed up
with his new title, and more indignant than ever
that a baronet should have such a son, refused
him admission to Field Place by the footman. He
sat down on the doorstep and read <span class='it'>Comus</span> from
Mary’s pocket-copy of Milton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the doctor came out to tell him his
father was greatly incensed with him. Then, his
cousin, Shelley Sidney, stealthily appeared to give
the Prodigal Grandson details of the Will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A most extraordinary Will. The fixed idea of
old Sir Bysshe had been to found an enormous
hereditary fortune, and for that purpose to
increase the entailed estates as much as possible.
He left in real and personal property, possessions
which probably did not fall short of £200,000.
One portion of this, valued at £80,000, formed
the estate entail which must necessarily pass to
Percy on his father’s death. But Sir Bysshe
desired that this accumulation of his long life
should be kept together by his descendants, and
should pass from eldest son to eldest son through
future generations of Shelleys. For this purpose,
the consent and signature of his grandson were
necessary, and he had hoped to obtain them in
the following manner. If Percy would concur in
prolonging the entail, and further, would agree to
entail the unsettled estates, he should, after his
father’s death, enjoy the usufruct of the entire
fortune. If he should refuse, then he would only
inherit, always after the death of Sir Timothy, the
£80,000 of which it was impossible to deprive
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley went back to London musing over this
strange news, and called on his solicitor to discuss
it with him. He did not feel he could consent to
the extension of the entail, since he disapproved of
all such plutocratic legislation: nor did he desire,
either for himself or his children, the ownership of
so huge a fortune. What he wanted was an
immediate income sufficient to live on, according
to his inclinations, and a certain sum down, so as
to settle his debts. To secure these moneys, he
proposed, through his lawyer, to sell to his father
the reversion of the settled estates. The proposal
pleased Sir Timothy who had abandoned all hope
of ever bringing Percy to heel, and who now
thought only of his second son, John. Unfortunately
the lawyers were not sure that the
arrangement was legally possible under the terms
of the Will. These only authorized the re-sale by
Percy to his father of the estate of a grand-uncle,
valued at £18,000. This transaction took place
and Shelley received in exchange an income of one
thousand pounds a year during the joint lives of
Sir Timothy and himself, and in addition three
thousand pounds were advanced by Sir Timothy
towards the payment of his son’s debts. If this
was not a big fortune, it was at least the end of
straitened means, of furnished lodgings, and of
duns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His first thought was to make Harriet an
allowance. He promised her £200 a year, which
in addition to the £200 which her father allowed
her, should be sufficient for all her wants. Next
he undertook to pay off Godwin’s debts, and set
apart for that purpose the whole of his first year’s
annuity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “venerated friend” found the offer of one
thousand pounds far below his expectations. To
hear him talk, nothing was easier than to borrow,
on an inheritance now soon to fall in, the many
thousands of pounds of which the Skinner Street
book-shop stood so much in need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley, exasperated but courteous, informed
Godwin, with an indignation which he restrained,
of his surprise that Mary’s father should think it
proper to write to the seducer of his daughter to
ask him for money, and at the same time to refuse
to enter into any relations with that daughter herself,
who was foolish enough to suffer from it.
Godwin replied that it was precisely because he
was borrowing money from the seducer that he
could not receive Mary: his dignity would not
allow it! He could not risk having it said that he
had bartered his daughter’s honour for the payment
of his debts. His scruples were so
exaggerated that he returned a cheque drawn by
Shelley in his favour, with the remark that the
names of Shelley and of Godwin must not figure
on the same cheque. Shelley could make it payable
to Joseph Hume or James Martin, and then
he, Godwin, might consent to cash it. On which
the following letters were exchanged:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Shelley to Godwin.</span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I confess that I do not understand how the
pecuniary engagements subsisting between us in
any degree impose restrictions on your conduct towards me.
They did not, at least to your knowledge
or with your consent, exist at the period of
my return from France, and yet your conduct towards
me and your daughter was then precisely
such as it is at present.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In my judgment neither I nor your daughter
nor her offspring ought to receive the treatment
which we encounter on every side. It has perpetually
appeared to me to have been your
especial duty to see that, so far as mankind value
your good opinion, we were dealt justly by, and
that a young family, innocent and benevolent and
united, should not be confounded with prostitutes
and seducers. My astonishment, and I will confess
when I have been treated with most harshness
and cruelty by you, my indignation has been
extreme, that, knowing as you do my nature, any
considerations should have prevailed on you to
have been thus harsh and cruel. Do not talk of
forgiveness again to me, for my blood boils in my
veins, and my gall rises against all that bears the
human form, when I think of what I, their benefactor
and ardent lover, have endured of enmity
and contempt from you and from all mankind.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXII<br/> <br/> DON JUAN CONQUERED</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Mary’s child was born before its time, and the
doctor said it would not live. Shelley kept watch
between the cradle and the bed in company with
Livy and Seneca. Fanny came round with baby-clothes
sent by Mrs. Godwin in her capricious
way, but the Philosopher remained inflexible.
Hogg dropped in to gossip, to tell the great news
of the day, the return from Elba, and he did Mary
good by his common sense and sarcasm. With a
temperature, and always in the society of Shelley,
she had the rather terrifying if pleasant impression
of slipping away out of life. Hogg brought her
back to a sense of reality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of predictions the child did live and
grew. Mary began to feel easy about it, when
at the end of the month she found on waking one
morning that it was dead. This was a great
sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley and Claire continued their walks
together, while Mary stayed at home. She sat
knitting and thinking of her little child. “I
was a mother, and am so no longer,” she kept
repeating, and at night she dreamed that the
baby was not dead, and that by rubbing it before
the fire they had brought it back to life. Then
she awoke to find the cradle empty. From the
streets floated up the hoarse shouting of crowds.
It was a time of riots. France threatened war.
Mary saw everything through a mist of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Claire’s presence in the house vexed her more
and more. She was certain that Claire was in
love with Shelley, had always been in love with
him. Percy’s loyalty was self-evident, his
morality super-human, angelic; but he thought
it possible to read Petrarch with an impassioned
girl, to direct her studies, to sit up with her the
whole night through, without danger. Mary
said to herself: “My charming Shelley understands
the elves better than he does women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she was alone with him in the evening,
she confessed her jealousy. It was a sentiment
he could not understand. He thought it base,
and that it belittled his divine Mary. He knew
his capacity for love to be infinite, and that in
dividing it with another woman he took away
nothing from his mistress. The company of the
wild and brilliant Claire was very precious to him,
but he had to acknowledge that the atmosphere of
this threefold union was becoming irrespirable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary besought him to send Claire away.
“Your friend,” as she now always called her.
They tried, during many weeks, to find a place for
her as governess or companion, but the unfortunate
reputation which her flight to France had
earned her rendered all such attempts futile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Claire herself had not the smallest desire to
leave. She delighted in her intellectual intimacy
with Percy, and she awaited its inevitable result
without fear. Finally, however, Mary’s gentle
firmness carried the day, and it was arranged that
Claire should go to Lynmouth, and lodge there
with a friend of Godwin’s, a Mrs. Bricknell, a
widow.</p>

tea talk. Shelley and his friend have a last
conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Saturday.</span>—Claire goes; Shelley walks with
her. Jefferson does not come till five. Gets very
anxious about Shelley, goes out to meet him:
returns: it rains. Shelley returns at half-past six;
the business is finished. Read Ovid. Charles
Clairmont comes to tea. Talk of pictures. I
begin a new journal with our regeneration.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Claire, exiled to the country, enjoyed after such
storm and stress her first days of profound peace.
But she was not the girl to put up for long with
rural solitude. She must have a reason for
living—and she did not fail to find one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When people are in love they always imagine,
quite wrongly, that it is because they have come
across an exceptional being who has inspired them
with the passion. The truth is that love, existing
already in the soul, seeks out a suitable
object, and if it does not find one, then creates
it. But if, in an ordinary girl, this love-seeking
is unconscious, it was otherwise with the brilliant
and hot-blooded Claire. Realizing the impossibility
of taking Shelley from her sister, or even of
sharing him with her, she deliberately looked
round for some other hero on whom to expend her
unemployed affection. Some women in such case
send letters to great writers, or soldiers, or actors.
But Claire, who was poetical, desired a poet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She found none more worthy of her than
George Gordon, Lord Byron, the man the most
worshipped and the most hated in the whole of
England. She knew his poems by heart, Shelley
had so often read them to her with enthusiasm.
She knew the stories of vice and wit, of diabolical
charm and infernal cruelty which were woven
round his name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His extraordinary beauty, his title, his genius
as a writer, the boldness of his ideas, the scandals
of his love affairs, all contributed to make of him
the perfect hero. He had had mistresses among
the highest in the land, the Countess of Oxford,
Lady Frances Webster, and the unfortunate Lady
Caroline Lamb, who the first day that she met him
wrote in her journal: “Mad, bad and dangerous
to know”: and then underneath, “But this pale
handsome face holds my destiny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had married, and all London repeated the
tale that, when he got into the carriage after the
ceremony, he said to Lady Byron: “You are
now my wife, and that is enough for me to hate
you. Were you some one else’s wife, I might
perhaps care about you.” He had treated her
with such contempt that she had been driven to
ask for a separation from him at the end of the
first year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Claire, who sought only for difficult adventures,
and had supreme confidence in herself, found out
Byron’s address and decided to chance her luck.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Claire to Byron.</span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“An utter stranger takes the liberty to addressing
you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is not charity I demand for of
that I stand in no need.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I tremble with fear
at the fate of this letter. I cannot blame if it
shall be received by you as an impudent imposture.
It may seem a strange assertion, but it is
not the less true that I place my happiness in your
hands.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If a woman, whose reputation has
yet remained unstained, if without either guardian
or husband to control, she should throw herself
on your mercy, if with a beating heart she should
confess the love she has borne you many years,
if she should return your kindness with fond affection
and unbounded devotion, could you betray her,
or would you be silent as the grave? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I must
entreat your answer without delay. Address me
as E. Trefusis, 21 Noley Place, Mary Le Bonne.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Don Juan made no reply. This unknown writer
of ornate style was small game for him. But
there is no one more tenacious than a woman tired
of her virtue. Claire returned to the attack a
second time. “Sunday Morning. Lord Byron is
requested to state whether seven o’clock this
evening will be convenient to him to receive a lady
to communicate with him on business of peculiar
importance. She desires to be admitted alone
and with the utmost privacy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Byron sent out word by the servant that
he had left town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Claire wrote in her own name that, wanting
to go on the stage, and knowing that Lord
Byron was interested in Drury Lane Theatre, she
would like to ask his advice. Byron’s reply was
to recommend her to call on the stage manager.
Undeterred, she made, at once, a skilful change
of front. It was not a theatrical career but the
literary life which she now desired. She had
written half a novel and would so very much like
to submit it to Byron’s judgment. As he continued
to keep silence, or to send evasive replies,
she risked offering him the only thing which a man
with any self-respect seldom refuses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may appear to you imprudent, vicious, but
one thing at least time shall show you, that I love
gently and with affection, that I am incapable of
anything approaching to the feeling of revenge or
malice. I do assure you your future shall be
mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any objection to the following
plan? On Thursday evening we may go out of
town together by some stage or mail about the
distance of ten or twelve miles. There we shall be
free and unknown; we can return early the following
morning. I have arranged everything here
so that the slightest suspicion may not be excited.
Pray do so with your people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you admit me for two moments to <span class='it'>settle</span>
with you <span class='it'>where</span>? Indeed, I will not stay an
instant after you tell me to go.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do what
you will or go where you will, refuse to see me
and behave unkindly, I shall ever remember the
gentleness of your manners and the wild originality
of your countenance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then that Don Juan, trapped and tired
by the long pursuit, decided to accept his defeat.
He had already decided to leave England and fix
himself in Switzerland or Italy, and the prospect of
a speedy departure set welcome limits to this
unwelcome amour.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXIII<br/> <br/> ARIEL AND DON JUAN</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Don Juan counted, however, without the energy
of Elvira. Claire had made up her mind to follow
him to Switzerland, and this dark-eyed girl was a
flame and a force. She arranged that the Shelleys
should chaperon her, knowing that they, too,
would welcome the idea of a change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since she left them, they had been living at
Bishopsgate, on the border of Windsor Forest,
and beneath the oak-shades of the Great Park
Shelley had composed his first long poem since
<span class='it'>Queen Mab</span>. This was <span class='it'>Alastor, or the Spirit of
Solitude</span>, an imaginative interpretation of his
spiritual experiences, and a record of the exquisite
mountain, river, and woodland scenery of the past
year. The tone differs from that of his previous
works. Melancholy and resignation soften down
the confident assertions of earlier years, and
religious and moral theories, if still serving as a
peg, get somewhat pushed into the background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the preface he shows the Poet thirsting for
love and dying because he cannot find it. But,
says Shelley, it is better to die than to live as
do the comfortable worldlings, “who, deluded by
no generous error, instigated by no sacred thirst
of doubtful knowledge, duped by no illustrious
superstition, loving nothing on this earth, and
cherishing no hopes beyond—yet keep aloof from
sympathies with their kind, rejoicing neither in
human joy, nor mourning with human grief; these
and such as they have their appointed curse.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
They are morally dead. They are neither friends,
nor lovers, nor fathers, nor citizens of the world,
nor benefactors of their country .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they live
unfruitful lives, and prepare for their old age a
miserable grave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Shelley had no regrets for his actions,
all the same, life in England had become odious
to him. Mary, as an unmarried wife, suffered
from her social ostracism, and thought that if they
went abroad, where their story would be unknown,
she would have more chance of making friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had given birth to a second child in January,
1816, a fine little boy whom she had named
William, after Godwin. The expenses of the
household, with the addition of a nurse, were
heavy, the income small. Life in Switzerland was
said to be cheap; Claire, at least, had little difficulty
in persuading her that it was so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As in the time of their first flight from London
the extraordinary trio crossed France, Burgundy,
the Jura, and, reaching Geneva, settled down at
Sécheron, one of its suburbs, in the Hôtel
d’Angleterre. The house was on the edge of the
lake, from its windows they saw the sun sparkling
on every wave-crest of the blue water, and in the
distance the black mountain-ridges that seemed to
quiver in the sunny atmosphere. Farther away
still, a brilliant and solid-looking white cloud spoke
of the snow peaks of the Alps. The change to this
golden climate after English greyness and London
gloom was delicious. They hired a boat, and
passed long days upon the water, reading and
sleeping.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>While they lived thus, a band of happy children,
with the blue sky above them, and the blue lake
beneath, Childe Harold in the most sumptuous of
travelling carriages was crossing Flanders on his
way to join them. England, in one of those crazy
fits of virtue which alternate with periods of the
most amazing licence, had just hounded Byron
from her shores. When he entered a ball-room
every woman would leave it, as though he were the
devil in person. He determined to shake for ever
from his shoes the dust of so hypocritical a land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His departure was accompanied by the most
frenzied curiosity. Society, which punishes
cruelly any revolt of the elemental instincts, nevertheless,
in her heart of hearts, admires the rebel
and envies him. At Dover, where the Pilgrim
embarked, a double line of spectators stood on
either side of the gangway. Great ladies borrowed
the clothes of their chamber-maids, so as
to mix unobserved with the crowd. People
pointed out to one another the enormous packing-cases
containing his sofa, his books, his services
of china and glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sea was rough, and Byron reminded his
travelling companions that his grandfather
Admiral Byron was nicknamed “Foul-weather
Jack” because he never put to sea without a squall
blowing up. He took a certain pleasure in painting
his own portrait against this traditional stormy
background. Unfortunately, he would have his
misfortunes transcendent.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days later there was great commotion at
the Hôtel d’Angleterre. Every one was on edge
expecting the arrival of the noble lord. Claire was
tremulous in spite of her audacity, Shelley, in the
happiest spirits, was impatient. He was not
shocked by the affair between Byron and Claire.
On the contrary he hoped to see the same ties
formed between Byron and his sister-in-law as
existed between himself and Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Shelleys were not disappointed by Byron’s
first appearance. His beauty was extraordinary.
To begin with, you were struck by his air of pride
and intellect; next, you noticed the moonlight
paleness of his skin, his splendid dark blue eyes,
his black and slightly curling hair, the perfect
line of his eyebrows. The nose and chin were
firm and well-drawn, the mouth full and voluptuous.
His only defect appeared in his walk.
“Club-footed” was said of him. “Cloven-footed”
he insinuated of himself, for he preferred
to be considered diabolic rather than infirm. Mary
saw that his lameness embarrassed him, for whenever
he had to take a few steps before spectators
he made some satanic jest. In the register-book
of the hotel, against the word “age” he wrote
“a hundred.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byron and Shelley got on well together. Byron
was glad to find him a man of his own class, who
in spite of hardships had retained the charming
ease of manner peculiar to the young aristocrat.
His cultivation was astounding. Byron, too, had
read enormously, but without Shelley’s serious
application. Shelley had read to know, Byron had
read to dazzle, and Byron was perfectly well aware
of the difference. He felt, too, the instant conviction
that Shelley’s will was a force, a bent bow,
while his own floated loose on the current at the
mercy of his passions and of his mistresses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley, the least vain of men, did not observe
this admiration for him, which Byron took care
to hide. While listening to the third canto of
<span class='it'>Childe Harold</span> he was moved to enthusiasm and
discouragement. In the superb energy of the
poem, which rose and swelled, irresistibly like a
flood, he recognized genius and despaired of ever
equalling it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if the poet filled him with admiration, the
man filled him with astonishment. He had expected
a Titan in revolt, and he found a wounded aristocrat
fully alive to the pleasures and pains of vanity,
which seemed to Shelley so puerile. Byron had
outraged convention, but, all the same, he believed
in it. It had stood in the path of his desires, and
he had flung it aside, but with regret. That which
Shelley had done ingenuously, he had done consciously.
Banished from society, he valued
nothing so much as social success. A bad husband,
it was only to legitimate love that he paid
respect. His mouth overflowed with cynicism,
but it was by way of reprisals, not from conviction.
Between marriage and depravity he recognized
no middle path. He had sought to terrify
his compatriots by acting an audacious part, but
only because he had despaired of conquering them
by acting a traditional one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley looked to women as a source of exaltation,
Byron as a pretext for idling. Shelley
angelic, too angelic, venerated them. Byron
human, too human, desired them and talked of
them in the most contemptuous fashion. “It is
the plague of these women,” said he, “that you
cannot live with them or without them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
cannot make up my mind whether or not women
have souls. My beau-ideal would be a woman with
talent enough to understand and value mine, but
not sufficient to be able to shine herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The upshot of certain of their conversations was
surprising. Shelley, mystical without knowing it,
managed to scandalize Byron, a Don Juan in spite
of himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This did not prevent them from being excellent
company one for the other. When Shelley, always
a great fisher of souls, tried to win over his
friend to a less futile conception of life, Byron
defended his point of view by brilliant paradoxes
which delighted Shelley the artist, as much as they
pained Shelley the moralist. Both were passionately
fond of the water. They bought a boat,
keeled and clinker-built, in which they went on
the lake every evening with Mary, Claire, and
Byron’s medical attendant, the handsome young
Italian, Polidori. Byron and Shelley, sitting silent,
would ship their oars to follow with their gaze
fleeting shapes amidst the moon-lit clouds; Claire
would sing, and her warm, delicious voice carried
their thoughts with it over the starry waters in
a voluptuous flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One night of strong wind Byron, defying the
storm, said he would sing them an Albanian song.
“Now be sentimental and give me all your attention.”
It was a strange wild howl that he gave
forth, laughing the while at their disappointment,
who had expected a wild Eastern melody. From
that day onward Mary and Claire named him “the
Albaneser,” and “Albé” for short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two poets made a literary pilgrimage round
the lake. They visited the spot where Rousseau
has placed his <span class='it'>Nouvelle Héloïse</span>, “Clarens, sweet
Clarens, birthplace of deep Love”; and Lausanne
and Ferney, full of memories of Gibbon and
Voltaire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley’s enthusiasm gained Byron, who wrote
under its influence some of his finest lines. Near
Meillerie one of the sudden lake-storms nearly upset
the boat. Byron began to strip. Shelley, who
could not swim, sat still with folded arms. His
calmness increased Byron’s admiration for him,
although he hid it more carefully than ever. Long
afterwards Shelley, speaking of this storm, said,
“I knew that my companion would try to save
me, and it was a humiliating idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sick of hotel life and the impertinent curiosity
of their fellow-boarders, the Shelleys hired a cottage
at Coligny on the edge of the lake. Byron
settled himself at the Villa Diodati, a short distance
away. The two houses were only separated by a
vineyard. Here, some vine-dressers at work in
the early morning saw Claire come out of Byron’s
villa and run across to Shelley’s. She lost a
slipper on the way, but ashamed of being seen did
not stop to pick it up. The honest Swiss peasants,
chuckling hugely, made haste to carry the slipper
of the English “Miss” to the mayor of the
village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her love affair did not prosper. She was with
child, and Byron was utterly tired of her. He let
her see it. For a moment perhaps he had admired
her voice, and her vivacity, but very soon she bored
him. Nor did he feel himself in any way bound
to this young woman who had thrust herself upon
him with such pertinacity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Carry off’ quotha! and ‘girl.’ I should
like to know <span class='it'>who</span> has been carried off except
poor dear <span class='it'>me</span>. I have been more ravished myself
than anybody since the Trojan War. I am accused
of being hard on women. It may be so, but I
have been their martyr. My whole life has been
sacrificed <span class='it'>to</span> them and <span class='it'>by</span> them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley went to talk with him of Claire’s future,
and of the child’s. As to Claire’s, Byron was perfectly
indifferent. All he wanted was to get rid
of her as soon as possible and never to see her
again. Shelley had nothing to say on this point,
but he defended the rights of the unborn child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first Byron had the idea of confiding it to his
sister Augusta. Claire refusing her consent, he
then undertook to look after the child himself as
soon as it was a year old, on condition that he
should be absolutely master of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It became difficult for the Shelleys to remain in
his neighbourhood. Not that there was any coldness
between the two men, for while Shelley had
found the negotiations for Claire painful, they had
seemed to him perfectly natural. But Claire herself
suffered, and Mary was often indignant at
Byron’s cynical talk. When he declared that
women had no right to eat at the same table with
men, that their proper place was in the harem or
gynæceum, the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft
trembled with anger. Once more she was homesick
for English scenes. A house beside some
English river now appeared to her, at this distance
away, a haven of peace. Shelley wrote to
his friends, Peacock and Hogg, to find something
for them, and the journey home began.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>After they had gone, Byron wrote to his sister:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Now don’t scold; but what could I do? A
foolish girl, in spite of all I could say or do, would
come after me, or rather went before—for I found
her here—and I had all the plague possible to persuade
her to go back again, but at last she went.
Now, dearest, I do most truly tell thee that I
could not help this, that I did all I could to prevent
it. I was not in love nor have any love left
for any; but I could not exactly play the Stoic with
a woman, who had scrambled eight hundred miles
to unphilosophize me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And now you know
all that I know of the matter, and it’s over.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley remained in correspondence with Byron
and did not give up hopes of “saving” him.
Mingled with an immense deference for the great
poet, Shelley’s letters show a trace of haughty disapproval
of the character of the man. He opposed
to Byron’s constant anxiety concerning his reputation,
his success, and what was said of him in
London, a picture of true glory.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it nothing to create greatness and goodness,
destined perhaps to infinite extensions? Is
it nothing to become a source whence the minds
of other men will draw strength and beauty? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
What would Humanity be if Homer and Shakespeare
had never written? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Not that I advise
you to aspire to Fame. Your work should spring
from a purer, simpler source. You should desire
nothing more than to express your own thoughts,
and to address yourself to the sympathy of those
who are capable of thinking as you do. Fame
follows those whom she is unworthy to guide.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Byron, who was then on his way to Venice,
read these lofty counsels with a weary indifference.
Exacting veneration bored him.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXIV<br/> <br/> GRAVES IN THE GARDEN OF LOVE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Of the three young girls who had given life and
gaiety to the house in Skinner Street, one only,
Fanny Imlay, was left. She alone, who was neither
Godwin’s child, nor yet Mrs. Godwin’s, lived at
home with them and called them “papa” and
“mamma.” She alone, so gentle and so loving,
had found neither lover nor husband. Modest and
unselfish, these are virtues which men praise—and
pass by. For a moment she had wondered whether
Percy would not think of her, and with a beating
heart had begun a correspondence with him. But
Mary’s hazel eyes had quenched the hopes to which
the timid Fanny had never given definite form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this silent home, saddened by money-worries,
it was on Fanny that Mrs. Godwin wreaked her ill-humour,
while Godwin let her understand that he
could not continue to keep her, and that she ought
to see about earning her own living. She asked
nothing better, and would have liked to become a
teacher, but the flight of Mary and Jane had thrown
a mantle of disrepute over the household, and the
heads of schools distrusted the way in which the
Godwin girls had been brought up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sick at heart and with a touch of envy, Fanny
admired from afar her sisters’ life of wild adventure,
a life which was sometimes dangerous, but always
amusing. How she, too, would have loved to be over
there at Lake Leman, in the company of the famous
Lord Byron, of whom all London was talking!</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Is his face as fine as in your portrait of him?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Tell me also if he has a pleasing voice, for
that has a great charm with me. Does he come into
your house in a careless, friendly, dropping-in
manner? I wish to know, though not from idle
curiosity, whether he was capable of acting in the
manner that London scandal-mongers say he did.
I cannot think from his writings that he can be
such a <span class='it'>detestable being</span>. Do answer me these
questions, for where I love the poet, I should like
to respect the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shelley’s boat excursion with him must have
been very delightful.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I long very much to
read the poems the ‘Poet’ has written on the spot
where Julie was drowned. When will they be
published in England? May I see them in manuscript?
Say you have a friend who has few
pleasures, and is very impatient to read them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It is impossible to tell the good that <span class='sc'>Poets</span> do their
fellow creatures, at least those that can feel. Whilst
I read I am a poet. I am inspired with good feelings—feelings
that create perhaps a more permanent
good in me than all the everyday preachments
in the world; it counteracts the dross which
one gives on the everyday concerns of life and tells
us there is something yet in the world to aspire
to—something by which succeeding ages may be
made happy and perhaps better.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mary and Claire would read these charming letters
with a condescending pity. Poor Fanny! How
Skinner Street! Always thinking that Godwin’s
novels, Godwin’s debts, and Mrs. Godwin’s bad
tempers were the most important things in the
world! Fanny’s slavery gave the two others a
more vivid appreciation of their own freedom. Her
loneliness enhanced for them the value of their lovers’
society, and, in their compassion for her, Mary got
Shelley to buy her a watch before leaving Geneva.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Shelleys and Claire came back to
England, to settle down at Bath, they saw Fanny
as they passed through London. She was depressed,
and spoke of nothing but her loneliness and her uselessness;
no one wanted her. In saying good-bye
to Shelley, her voice quivered. Yet she wrote to
him at Bath with the same affectionate frankness as
before, although her letters now had that indefinable
note of reproach which those who lead a death-in-life
feel towards those whose life is filled with living.
Godwin, his literary work broken into by fresh
money troubles, became more and more grumpy; an
aunt, Everina Wollstonecraft, who had promised
to take Fanny as governess in her school, wrote to
say that a sister of Mary and Claire would certainly
be too terrifying a teacher for the narrow-minded
middle-class parents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning the Shelleys received from Bristol
a curious letter, in which Fanny bade them farewell
in mysterious sentences: “I am going to a place
whence I hope never to return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary implored Shelley to go to Bristol at once.
He came home during the night without any news.
Next morning he went again, and this time brought
Mary lamentable tidings. Fanny had left Bristol for
Swansea by the Cambrian Coach, and had put up
at the Mackworth Arms Inn. She had gone at once
to her room telling the chamber-maid that she was
tired. When she did not come down next morning,
her door was forced, and she was found lying dead,
her long brown hair spread about her. By her was
the little Genevan watch given her by Mary and
Shelley. On the table was a bottle of laudanum
and the beginning of a letter:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I have long determined that the best thing I
could do was to put an end to the existence of a
being whose birth was unfortunate, and whose life
has only been a series of pain to those persons who
have hurt their health in endeavouring to promote her
welfare. Perhaps to hear of my death will give you
pain, but you will soon have the blessing of forgetting
that such a creature ever existed as .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Godwin had taught in <span class='it'>Political Justice</span> that
suicide is not a crime; the only difficulty being to
decide in each individual case whether the social
advantage of thirty supplementary years of life
forbids recourse to a voluntary death. After the
tragedy he wrote to Mary for the first time since
her flight. It was to implore the three outcasts to
avoid anything leading to publicity, “which to a
mind in anguish is one of the severest of all trials.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley’s nerves were badly shaken by Fanny’s
terrible death, and Mrs. Godwin in her amiable
way insinuated she had killed herself for love of
him. He then remembered certain signs of emotion
he had seen in her, and reproached himself for
having always considered her as of a slightly lower
status. Perhaps he had, though quite unwittingly,
awakened her love at the moment when, deserted
by Harriet, he sought a shelter in any feminine
tenderness. Perhaps she had weighed and counted
and analysed with care, words and glances, into
which he had meant to put mere friendliness.
“How difficult it is to understand the soul of
another; How much suffering one may cause without
wishing it, or knowing it; How one may live
in presence of the most profound, sometimes of the
most despairful feelings without even suspecting
their existence!” It does not suffice therefore to
be sincere, nor to have good intentions. You can
do just as much harm through not understanding
as through unkindness. He was plunged into a
blank despondency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To shake it off, he went to spend a few days
alone with a young literary critic, Leigh Hunt, who
had praised his poetry with intelligence and
enthusiasm. Hunt lived on Hampstead Heath in the
Vale of Health, a spot as tree-embowered and
almost as charming to-day as it was then. His
wife Marianne was homely and hospitable. He had
a whole brood of jolly children with whom Shelley
could walk and play. There, he could forget for a
time poor Fanny and Godwin. The visit was short
but delicious, and he came home much cheered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his return, he found awaiting him a letter
from Hookham, which he opened eagerly, for he had
asked Hookham to find out for him what Harriet
was doing. He had had no news of her for two
months. She had drawn her allowance in March
and in September, being then in her father’s house.
But since October nothing was known of her.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Sir,” Hookham wrote, “It is nearly
a month since I had the pleasure of receiving a
letter from you, and you have no doubt felt surprised
that I did not reply to it sooner. It was my
intention to do so; but on enquiring, I found the
utmost difficulty in obtaining the information you
desire relative to Mrs. Shelley and your children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While I was yet endeavouring to discover
Mrs. Shelley’s address, information was brought
me that she was dead—that she had destroyed herself.
You will believe that I did not credit the report.
I called at the house of a friend of Mr. Westbrook;
my doubt led to conviction. I was informed that
she was taken from the Serpentine river on Tuesday
last.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Little or no information was laid before
the jury which sat on the body.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The verdict
was <span class='it'>found drowned</span>. Your children are well and are
both, I believe, in London.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley went up to town in an agonizing condition
of mind. With horror he saw in imagination
the blonde and childlike head, which he had so
loved, befouled by the mud of the river-bed, green
and swollen through its sojourn in the water. He
asked himself how was it possible she could have
abandoned her children and chosen so dreadful a
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hunts and Hookham showed him every
kindness, and told him all they knew. A paragraph
in <span class='it'>The Times</span> stated: “On Thursday a respectable
female far advanced in pregnancy was taken out
of the Serpentine river, and brought home to her
residence in Queen Street, Brompton, having been
missed for nearly six weeks. She had a valuable
ring on her finger. A want of honour in her own
conduct is supposed to have led to this fatal
catastrophe, her husband being abroad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gossips of Queen Street repeated the little
they had gleaned: Harriet no longer received
letters from her husband, because her former landlady
had failed to forward them, and she had given
up all hope of his ever coming back to her. She
had fallen, from despair. Living first with an army
officer, he had been obliged to leave her on his
regiment being ordered to India. Then, unable to
endure the loneliness of life, she found a protector
of humble grade, said to be a groom, and that he
deserted her. The Westbrooks had deprived her of
her children, and refused to receive her back. She
was said to be in the family way, absolutely alone,
and terrified at the approaching scandal. Then,
came the body in the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley passed an appalling night.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Far
advanced in pregnancy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” What an end to
her life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what madness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Detailed and
intimate memories of poor Harriet crowded back
into his mind against his will, and he saw in
imagination with terrible vividness the last
scenes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Harriet in love, Harriet in terror,
Harriet in despair .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. every expression he knew
too well. Ah, this name which during a few years
had meant the whole world to him, for the future
he must associate with all that is basest and most
vile! “Harriet, my wife, a prostitute! Harriet, my
wife, a suicide!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were moments when he asked himself if
he were not responsible, but he pushed this idea
from him with all his strength. “I did my duty.
Always on every occasion in life, I have done what
seemed to me the loyal and disinterested thing to
do. When I left her, I no longer loved her. I
assured her existence to the utmost of my means,
and even beyond them. Never have I treated her
with unkindness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is those odious Westbrooks
alone.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ought I to have sacrificed my sanity
and my life, to one who was unfaithful to me, and
second-rate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His reason told him “No.” Hogg and Peacock,
who surrounded him with affectionate attentions,
told him “No.” He besought them to repeat it to
him, for at instants he seemed to glimpse some
mysterious and super-human duty towards Harriet,
in which he had failed. “In breaking traditional
ties one sets free in man unknown forces, the
consequences of which one cannot foresee.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Freedom is only good for the strong .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for those
who are worthy of it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Harriet’s soul was
weak.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Ah, little head, blonde and childlike,
of drowned Harriet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day he wrote a tender letter to Mary, eager
to dwell by contrast on her gentle serenity. He
asked her to become a mother to his “poor babes,
Ianthe and Charles.” His counsel had just informed
him that the Westbrooks would take action to contest
his guardianship of the children, on the pretext
that his irreligious opinions, and his living in
concubinage with Miss Godwin, rendered him unfit
to bring them up.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXV<br/> <br/> THE RULES OF THE GAME</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In what way does a marriage ceremony, religious
or civil, add to the happiness of a pair of lovers,
deeply smitten and full of confidence in one another?
The event proved that it can at least make joy
blossom on the countenance of a pedant. Godwin’s
exhibited an incredible satisfaction on learning that
“the seducer” was going to make “an honest
woman” of his daughter, and that, eventually, she
would become Lady Shelley. He thus inspired in
his ex-disciple a contempt for his character, full
measure, pressed down, and running over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first there had been some hesitation as to
whether it were decent to celebrate the marriage
so soon after Harriet’s death, but the authorities
on social etiquette declared that it would not do
to wait any longer for the Church’s blessing on a
union which Nature had already blessed twice over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just a fortnight after the body of the first Mrs.
Shelley had been taken out of the Serpentine, Mary
and Percy were married by a clergyman in the
church of St. Mildred, Bread Street. Godwin, beaming
all over his face, and Mrs. Godwin, simpering
and pretentious, signed as witnesses. That evening,
for the first time since they ran away, the
Shelleys dined in Skinner Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The family feast was a lugubrious one. There, in
the little dining-room, Fanny had moved to and fro;
there, Harriet had sat in her happy early wedded days;
their ghosts, suffering and unsatisfied, continued to
haunt the room and torture the living. It is true
that Godwin’s ill-temper had been changed by the
morning’s ceremony into an excess of urbanity, but
too many memories troubled the guests to make
any real cordiality possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Mary wrote in her journal: “Go to
London. A marriage takes place. Draw. Read Lord
Chesterfield and Locke.” Mary had good nerves.
Poor drowned Harriet was never a patch on her.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, it was but right that the news of so
splendid a marriage should be sent to every Godwin
in the land. The Philosopher wrote to Hull
Godwin:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were it not that you have a family of your
own, and can see by them how little shrubs grow
into tall trees, you would hardly imagine that my
boy, born the other day, is now fourteen, and that
my daughter is between nineteen and twenty. The
piece of news I have to tell, however, is that
I went to church with this tall girl some little time
ago to be married. Her husband is the eldest son
of Sir Timothy Shelley, of Field Place, in the
county of Sussex, Baronet. So that according to
the vulgar ideas of the world she is well married,
and I have great hopes that the young man will
make her a good husband. You will wonder, I
daresay, how a girl without a penny of fortune
should make so good a match. But such are the ups
and downs of the world. For my part, I care
but little comparatively about wealth, so that it
should be her destiny in life to be respectable,
virtuous, and contented.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The letter closes with a word of cool thanks for
a ham and a turkey sent to the Skinner Street
household at Christmas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the formal marriage brought about one real
advantage. The “concubinage” argument,
advanced by those who wished to deprive Shelley
of his children, fell to the ground. The Westbrooks,
however, did not give in. By the voice of
the retired publican, the young Ianthe aged three,
and Charles aged two, addressed a petition to the
Lord Chancellor in which they said: “Our father
avows himself to be an Atheist, and has written
and published a certain work called <span class='it'>Queen Mab</span>
with notes, and other works, wherein he
blasphemously denies the existence of God as the
Creator of the Universe, the sanctity of marriage,
and all the most sacred principles of morality.”
For which reasons these precocious and virtuous
infants prayed that their persons and fortunes might
not be placed in the power of an unworthy father,
but under the protection of persons of the highest
morality, such as their maternal grandfather and
their kind Aunt Eliza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley’s counsel took care to say nothing in
defence of <span class='it'>Queen Mab</span>: there was nothing to be said
at that time, and in that place, the Court of Chancery.
He confined himself to denying the importance of
a work written by a boy of nineteen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Notwithstanding Mr. Shelley’s violent philippics
against marriage, Mr. Shelley marries twice
before he is twenty-five! He is no sooner liberated
from the despotic chains which he speaks of with
so much horror and contempt, than he forges a
new set, and becomes again a willing victim of
this horrid despotism! It is hoped that a consideration
of this marked difference between his opinions
and his actions will induce the Lord Chancellor not
to think very seriously of this boyish and silly
publication.” As to the proposal of placing the
children with their mother’s family: “We think
it right to say that Mr. Westbrook formerly kept
a coffee-house, and is certainly in no respect qualified
to be the guardian of Mr. Shelley’s children. To
Miss Westbrook there are more decided objections:
she is illiterate and vulgar, and it was by her
advice, with her active concurrence, and it may be
said by her <span class='it'>management</span>, that Mr. Shelley, when
of the age of nineteen, ran away with Miss Harriet
Westbrook, then of the age of seventeen, and
married her in Scotland. Miss Westbrook, the proposed
guardian, was then nearly thirty, and, if she had
acted as she ought to have done as the guardian
and friend of her younger sister, all this misery and
disgrace to both families would have been avoided.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His counsel’s ingenious notion of winning his
client’s case by renouncing in that client’s name
the opinions of his youth, seemed to Shelley a piece
of disgusting hypocrisy. He, therefore, drew up
for the Lord Chancellor a statement in which he
set forth that his ideas on marriage had not
changed, and that if he had made his conduct conform
to the customs of society, he in no way had
renounced the liberty to criticize those customs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lord Chancellor in his judgment remarks:
“This is a case in which a father has demonstrated
that he must and does deem it to be a matter of
duty to recommend to those whose opinions and
habits he may take upon himself to form conduct
as moral and virtuous, which the law calls upon
me to consider as immoral and vicious.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
cannot, therefore, in these conditions, entrust him
with the guardianship of these children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Lord Chancellor refused to confide them
to the odious Westbrooks. He put them under the
care of an Army doctor, named Hume, of Brent
End Lodge, Hanwell, who would place the boy,
when seven years old, at a good private school
under the superintendence of an orthodox clergyman.
As to the little Ianthe, she would be brought
up at home by Mrs. Hume, who would see that
she said her morning prayers, and asked a blessing
on her food. Mrs. Hume would also put into her
hands improving books, and, to a certain extent
would encourage the reading of poetry, Shakespeare
for instance, if carefully Bowdlerized. The whole
cost, one hundred a year for each child. Mr.
Shelley might visit them twelve times a year, but
in the presence of Dr. and Mrs. Hume. Mr. John
Westbrook might see them the same number of
times, but, if he wished it, he might see them without
the Humes being present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This sentence was very bitter to Shelley. It
sanctioned officially so to say, and in reasonable
and moderate formulas, his exile from the community
of civilized men. It was like a brevet of
incurable folly.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the case was being fought out, he had
bought a house in the pleasant little country town
of Great Marlow. Ariel at last consented to have
a home like other people. One room, big enough for
a village ball-room, was fitted up as a library, and
decorated with casts of Venus and Apollo. There
was a very big garden: in this during the spring
and summer of 1817 might be seen two babies,
William and Clara Shelley, and a third child of
unusual beauty, Alba, daughter of Lord Byron and
Claire. Her father was said to be leading a wild
life at Venice. Claire received no news from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley’s recent trials had left their traces on his
countenance. He was thinner, more hectic, and
stooped more than ever. A violent pain in his side
prevented him from sleeping, and the doctors,
unable to cure it, said it was “a nervous disorder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His state of mind was despondent. Life had
brought him so much suffering, his good intentions
had been repaid by such evil results, that he had
taken a horror of every sort of action. He felt an
intense but undefined desire to withdraw from the
perilous throngs of men, men whose reactions cannot
be predicted, and who are swayed by such
terrible gusts of passion. The regeneration of the
real world now appeared to him so unrealizable
that he no longer sought satisfaction therein for his
loves and hatreds, but looked for it in the more docile
and malleable world of the imagination. Subjects
for poems, vague and shadow-like, floated round him,
which feeding on his sorrowful thoughts, gradually
took form at the expense of his powers of action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The aërial edifices, the crystalline palaces, which
with their filmy vapours had so long hidden from
him the actual world, seemed to detach themselves
from earth and to float up as though drawn by an
invisible force. They did not melt away, but swaying
with a gentle movement rose in all their translucent
glory to the high realms of pure Poetry.
In the place which they had occupied, Shelley now
saw the world as it is, the brown earth arduous to
cultivate, the harsh faces of men, women full of
nerves and hysteria, the cruel and obstructive society
from which he longed to escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poem which occupied his thoughts the
oftenest was the story of an ideal Revolution.
He did not want the scenes of bloodshed which
ruined for him the otherwise inspiring story of the
French Revolution. He wanted his Revolution to be
the work of a pair of lovers. His personal experience
had taught him that only the love of a woman can
inspire a sublime courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Laon and Cythna, two ideal anarchists, were to
be the transfigured portraits of himself and Mary.
He would make them die at the stake, for their
ideas, as he would have liked to die himself,
exchanging a last kiss in the midst of the flames,
a kiss so delicious that the agony would become
a sort of voluptuous refinement of ecstasy. For him
love did not attain its maximum unless he could
associate it with thoughts and sufferings shared in
common. Now that he and Mary, married and
fairly well off, seemed about to begin an easier life,
he desired to escape from this somewhat commonplace
happiness, and to live in imagination the
magnificent and perilous destiny which might have
been his in other lands and other ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed his time among the little islands of
the Thames where the swans build their nests.
Lying at the bottom of his boat completely hidden
by the high grasses, he sought his inspiration in
gazing up at the changing skies. The study of
fleeting, interweaving colour and form had always
given him immense pleasure, and every day he felt
more strongly that his real mission in life was to
seize the most transitory shades of beauty, and to
fix them for ever in words buoyant and beautiful
as themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entire summer was given to this entrancing
work. Then he was obliged to go up to London.
Money was getting scarce; he had so many mouths
to feed. Besides Mary and the children, Claire and
Allegra were dependent on him, and very often the
entire Godwin household. His new friend, Leigh
Hunt, with a wife and five children, needed help.
He had promised Peacock a hundred a year so that
he might go on writing his fine novels. Charles
Clairmont, who was nothing to him, had fallen
in love when in France with an ugly woman several
years older than himself and of course penniless;
it was Shelley who provided the means for marriage.
Just as formerly, he had to go to the money-lenders
in order to satisfy these endless claims. “You’re
a thoroughbred,” Godwin once told him, “whom the
horse-flies prevent from taking your spring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Happily for him, Mary managed to bring him
back to earth, and he forgave her, seeing her now
only as the Cythna of his poem. But she, an over-anxious
hostess, did not care for their too assiduous
visitors, such as Peacock, who dropped in every
evening “without being asked,” and drank up a
whole bottle of wine. She wanted Shelley to find
a purchaser for the Marlow House which they had
bought too hastily. She saw he suffered from cold,
and wished to take him away to a warmer climate,
perhaps to Italy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest love,” she wrote to him in London.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Pray in your letters do be more explicit!
You have advertised the house, but have you given
Madocks any orders about how to answer applicants?
And have you settled yet for Italy or the
sea? And do you know how to get money to convey
us there, and to buy the things that will be absolutely
necessary before our departure? And can you
do anything for my father before you go? Or, after
all, would it not be as well to inhabit a small house
by the seashore where our expenses would be much
less than they are at present? You have not yet
mentioned to Godwin your thoughts of Italy; but
if you determine soon, I would have you do it, as
those things are always better to be talked of some
days before they take place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I took my first walk to-day! What a dreadfully
cold place this house is! I was shivering over
a fire and the garden looked cold and dismal, but
so soon as I got into the road I found to my infinite
surprise that the sun was shining and the air warm
and delightful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish Willy to be my companion in my future
walks; to further which plan will you send down if
possible by Monday’s coach, a sealskin fur hat for
him? It must be a fashionable round shape, <span class='it'>for
a boy</span> mention particularly, and have a narrow gold
ribbon round it, that it may be taken in if too
large.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am just now surrounded by babes.
Alba is scratching and crowing, William amusing
himself with wrapping a shawl round him, and Miss
Clara staring at the fire.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Adieu, dearest
love! I want to say again that you may fully
answer me, how very, very anxious I am to know
the whole extent of your present difficulties and
pursuits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One source of annoyance to Mary was the
presence of Alba in the house. The neighbours had
been told that she was the child of a lady in
London and had been sent to the country for
her health, but anyone could see from Claire’s
behaviour that the child was hers. The pure-minded
jumped at once to the conclusion that
Shelley was the father. The old accusations of
promiscuity again reared their heads, and Mary’s
prudishness suffered from it. One of the reasons
for which she wished to go to Italy was that the
journey would enable them to take the little girl
out to Lord Byron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley’s one wish also was to depart. The ties
of family, of friendship, of business, had raised
round him intangible walls behind which he was
stifling. His will was rock-like, but life’s little
waves, perfidious and unconcerned, ate away at it
ceaselessly. In England where the highest legal
dignity had taken from him his civic rights, he had
the sensation of standing always in the pillory. It
seemed to him that in flying from England, he
would become again a free and aërial spirit, that
in a new country his life would be like a sheet of
white paper on which he could compose a new
existence in the same way that he could compose
a poem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When their departure was fixed, Mary asked to
have the children baptized. She thought it was
better for them to start in life by observing the
Rules of the Game. Shelley agreed, and at the
same time that William Shelley and Clara Everina
Shelley were christened, Byron’s daughter was
christened too under the names of Clara Allegra.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXVI<br/> <br/> “QUEEN OF MARBLE AND OF MUD”</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The clear sky of Italy, the constant cloudless sky.
Once more the caravan of three went down towards
the lands of forgetfulness and sunshine. The
babies and nursemaids who this time went with it,
were hardly any drag on its rapid and whimsical
progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Milan was reached by way of the Mont Cenis,
where the first halt was made to await news of
Byron to whom Shelley had written informing him
of the arrival of his daughter. Shelley passed his
days in the Cathedral reading the <span class='it'>Inferno</span> and
<span class='it'>Purgatorio</span>, in a solitary spot behind the altar
where the light of day beneath the storied window
is yellow and dim. Churches no longer inspired
in him the horror they used to do. He was surprised
to find that since he had suffered so keenly,
no place now seemed to fit his feelings better or
to be a finer background to the greatness of human
passions than a church. In the company of Dante,
and in the midst of a symphony of warm, rich
colours, the Catholic religion no longer seemed to
be the invention of charlatans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byron’s answer came. Nothing on earth would
induce him to see Claire, and he would leave at
once any town to which she should come. As to
the child, he was willing to undertake the charge
of its education, but his possession must be
absolute. Shelley considered that this condition
was cruel, and pleaded with Byron to soften it.
But Byron, who above all things dreaded scenes
with Claire, refused to cede an iota. A Venetian
met in Milan gave tidings that the “English
Lord” was leading a life of debauchery, and keeping
a whole harem. Such news was hardly
reassuring for Allegra’s education, and Shelley
begged Claire to give up all idea of help from
Byron rather than let him have the child. As usual
he undertook to pay for everything himself. But
Claire, proud of Allegra’s birth, wanted to obtain
for her all the advantages of it. She had every
confidence in Elise the Swiss nurse who had
brought the baby up, and she decided to send them
both to Venice. In spite of Shelley’s affectionate
remonstrances Allegra was handed over to her
father.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Disquieting news of the child soon came to
trouble Claire. Byron had only kept it a few
weeks. At first very proud of its beauty and of
seeing it admired and made much of by the
Venetians on the Piazza, he soon tired of this and
allowed Mrs. Hoppner, wife of the English Consul,
to take charge of it. Who was this Mrs.
Hoppner? Elise wrote that she was a very kind
lady, but Claire began to suffer from terrible
remorse. During a whole year she had never been
parted from the child for a single hour. She
adored it. Allegra was the only creature in the
whole world she could call her very own, since her
family renounced her, and her lover refused to see
her. Shelley, unable to bear the sight of her
misery, offered to go with her to Venice. Mary
consented to the arrangement in spite of her dislike
at seeing these two start on a journey
together. Paolo, the servant, who was energetic
and seemed reliable, went with them as courier. In
order not to irritate Byron who had forbidden
Claire to enter any town where he might happen
to be, it was decided that she should stop at Padua
and wait there the upshot of Shelley’s embassy.
But finding herself so near to Allegra, she could
not resist going on. She thought that by keeping
her presence secret she could manage to see the
child, and so she and Shelley took a gondola and
went down the Brenta. They crossed the lagoon
in the middle of the night, in a violent storm of
wind, rain and lightning, while in the distance the
lights of Venice shone dimly behind a curtain of
mist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning they went to the Hoppners
who received them with courtesy and kindness.
Mrs. Hoppner sent at once for Elise and the baby.
She was much grown, was pale, and had lost a
great deal of her liveliness, but was as beautiful as
ever. Then they had a long conversation on the
subject of Byron. The Hoppners, worthy people
of conventional ideas, young lovers much excited
by all the intrigues going on round them though
humanized a little by Venetian indulgence, related
with many head-shakes:</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the third day of his arrival Byron had
provided himself, as he liked to boast, with a
gondola and a mistress. The mistress was
Marianna Segati, wife of a cloth-merchant, who
was the poet’s landlord, for he had let rooms to
Byron in his house. A most imprudent proceeding,
but the cloth-business was doing badly.
Marianna was twenty-two, had splendid black eyes,
and a delicious voice. Although belonging to the
middle classes, she was received by the aristocracy
of Venice on account of her singing. That she
should lose her heart to the noble lord who was
as generous as he was handsome, and who lived
under the same roof, was as inevitable as are the
simplest chemical reactions. As to the Merchant
of Venice, Byron was free with his ducats, and
Venetian morals always permitted <span class='it'>one</span> lover. Mrs.
Hoppner, a friendly little woman with intelligent
eyes, had told this story with that mixture of
Christian sorrow and mundane relish which the
virtuous employ in talking of the vicious. Her
husband, with many hums and haws, added that
this was not all. The Venetian populace circulated
a tale that somewhere in the city the English Lord
had a closed villa, in which, one Muse not sufficing
him, he had gathered together the whole Nine.
A legendary history was growing up concerning
Byron, and the travelling British spoke with bated
breath of Nero and Heliogabalus. The lower
classes adored him, and at Carnival time the women
took advantage of their masks and dominoes to hook
themselves on to his person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such gossip was far from reassuring to Claire.
She asked what ought she to do? The Consul
advised her above all things not to let Byron suspect
she was in Venice, for he often expressed his
extreme horror of her arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At three o’clock Shelley went to the Palazzo
Mocenigo to call on Byron, who was delighted to
see him, Shelley being perhaps the only man in
the world with whom Byron would talk seriously
and as crowned head to crowned head. Even
when told of the reason for Shelley’s journey, and
Claire’s great desire to see the child again, he
remained calm and reasonable. He said he
understood perfectly Claire’s anxiety, but that
he could not send Allegra back to her, because the
Venetians who already accused him of capriciousness,
would say he had grown tired of her.
However, he would think the matter over, and
find some way to arrange everything. On which,
he invited Shelley to go for a ride with him along
the Lido.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gondola took them across the lagoon, and
they disembarked on the long, sandy island which
defends Venice from the Adriatic. Nothing grows
here but sea-wrack and thistle. They found
Byron’s horses waiting for them. Shelley loved
all wild and solitary places, and this gallop along
the edge of the sea was delightful to him. Only
the knowledge that Claire, at the Hoppners’,
anxiously awaited his return, spoiled his pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byron inveighed against the stupidity of the
English. Those who came to Venice persecuted
him with their curiosity, and even offered money
to his servants to allow them to see his bedroom.
Then he spoke of Shelley’s own misfortunes
with many protestations of friendship. “Had
I been in England at the time of the Chancery
affair, I would have moved heaven and earth to
get you back your children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This led him on to speak of the wickedness of
humanity which he judged to be infinite. “Men
are filled with hatred of one another, to expect or
hope for anything else is the mark of the
visionary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked Shelley. “You appear to
believe that man is the victim of his instincts without
being able to direct them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My faith is
quite different. I think that our will creates our
virtue.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And though wickedness may be
natural that does not prove it to be invincible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byron pointed out the patrician city that the
setting sun suffused with gold and sombre purple.
“Let us get into the gondola again,” he said,
“I want to show you something.” When they
had glided for some moments over the lagoon,
“Look over to the west. Don’t you hear the
clang of a bell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley, looking, saw on a small island a
windowless, deformed, and dreary building, and
on the top of it an open tower in which a bell
swung in black relief against the crimson sky.
With the splash of the oars seemed to mingle
distant, stifled cries for help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” Byron said, “is the madhouse.
Every evening when I cross the water at this
hour, I hear the bell clanging the maniacs to
vespers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt that they may thank the Creator
for his mercy towards them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always the same Shelley!” laughed Byron.
“Infidel and blasphemer! You who can’t
swim, beware of providence! But you spoke just
now of vanquishing our instincts. Does it not
seem to you that this spectacle rather is an image
of our life? Conscience is the bell that calls us to
virtue. We obey it like the madmen without
knowing why. Then the sun sets, the bell stops,
it is the night of death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked towards Venice, which, huddled in
the twilight, had become a rose-tinged grey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We Byrons,” said he, “die young .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on
my father’s side, and on my mother’s as well.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It’s all the same to me, but I intend first to enjoy
my youth.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day Shelley, who had come to Byron
filled with forebodings, was agreeably surprised
to find him quite reasonable. He offered to lend
Shelley and Claire for two months a villa he
owned at Este, and to allow Allegra to go and
stay there with her mother. Shelley joyfully
accepted this generous offer, and he wrote to Mary
to come at once and join them:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been obliged to decide on all these
things without you. I have done for the best;
and, my own beloved Mary, you must soon come
and scold me if I have done wrong, and kiss me
if I have done right, for I am sure I do not know
which, and it is only the event that will show.
We shall at least be saved the trouble of introduction,
and have formed acquaintance with a
lady (Mrs. Hoppner) who is so good, so beautiful,
so angelically sweet, that were she as wise too,
she would be quite a Mary, but she is not very
accomplished. Her eyes are like a reflection of
yours; her manners are like yours when you know
and like a person.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Kiss the blue-eyed darlings
for me, and do not let Willmouse forget me.
Ca cannot recollect me.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mary’s journey was slow and disagreeable. At
Florence she was held up by passport difficulties.
The baby Clara, who was cutting her teeth,
suffered from heat, fatigue and the change of milk;
when Este was reached, she was dangerously ill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During fourteen days she remained in a state
of fever. The doctor seemed a stupid fellow, and
Mary decided to go on to Venice that she might
call in a better one. At Fusina the Austrian
custom-house officers stopped them and attempted
to prevent them from crossing the lagoon.
Shelley, who had gone to meet them at
Padua, insisted with extraordinary violence on
passing, and rushed for a gondola. The baby had
curious convulsive twitchings of the eyes and
mouth. During the voyage she was almost
unconscious. When the hotel was reached her
condition was still more alarming. Examined by
a doctor, he said at once there was no hope.
Within an hour she died silently and without
pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary found herself standing in the hall of a
strange inn with her dead child in her arms.
Mr. Hoppner came and took her and Shelley
away to his own house. The next morning
Shelley carried the little corpse in a gondola for
burial on the Lido, and Mary tried to shake off
her grief. It was one of Godwin’s doctrines that
only weak and cowardly natures abandon themselves
to sorrow, which could not last did we not
feed it in secret by finding a sort of painful vanity
in our sufferings. His daughter shared his ideas
on this point. The day after little Ca was buried,
she wrote in her journal:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Sunday, September 27.</span> Read fourth canto of
<span class='it'>Childe Harold</span>. It rains. Go to the Doge’s
Palace, Ponte dei Sospiri, etc. Go to the Academy
with Mr. and Mrs. Hoppner, and see some fine
pictures, call at Lord Byron’s and see the
Fornarina.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fornarina was Byron’s latest mistress, a
peasant woman with a face of the fine antique
Venetian type. “You will see how beautiful
she is,” Byron had told Shelley. “Very fine
black eyes and the figure of a Juno, wavy black
hair which reflects the moonlight: one of those
women who would go to hell for love. I like that
sort of animal, and I should certainly have preferred
Medea to any other woman in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly this beautiful baker’s wife was a
strange sort of animal, and quite untamable. She
was so fierce that all the servants were terrified of
her, even Tita, the gigantic gondolier. She was
jealous, insupportable, and false as the devil,
besides being perfectly ridiculous from the moment
she had insisted on replacing her veil and shawl
by fashionable gowns and hats with ostrich
feathers. Byron flung these into the fire every
time he saw them, and then she went out and
bought others. But he put up with her follies
because she amused him. He liked her vivacity,
her Venetian dialect, her violence. Her coarse
and animal nature was, he imagined, more of a
rest to him than anything else after intellectual
labour. Thanks to her his poem advanced with a
splendid motion, with something of the wild and
natural movement of the sea or the passionate love
of a woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the Shelleys, who were ultra-refined, this
magnificent animal was highly displeasing. They
exchanged sorrowful glances. During the few
days they spent in Venice, Shelley became better
acquainted with Byron’s mode of life and he
judged it with severity. The Poet admitted to
his orgies the lowest women picked up by his
<span class='it'>gondolieri</span> in the streets. Then, despising himself,
he decreed that man is despicable. His
cynicism now appeared to Shelley to be nothing
but a graceful mask for his sensuality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the Shelleys went back to Este,
depressed by their return there without their little
girl. Yet the house was cheerful. In the garden
a vine-covered pergola led to a summer-house
which Shelley made his study. From thence you
saw the ruins of the ancient castle of Este in the
foreground, then, like a green sea, Lombardy’s
waveless plains, on which cities and villages
seemed like islands bounded by vaporous air .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
in the distance many-domed Padua, a peopled
solitude, and the towers of Venice glittering in the
sunshine against a sapphire sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He worked hard. He had begun <span class='it'>Prometheus
Unbound</span>, a lyrical drama on the Book of Job. He
tried to fix in verse light as wing-beats the
melancholy beauty of these autumn days. But no
sooner had the intoxicating joy of composition
faded than he felt himself once more alone and
forgotten. It seemed to him that in the frail bark
which carried beneath an alien sky his group of
youthful exiles Misery stood at the helm.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXVII<br/> <br/> THE ROMAN CEMETERY</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of another month the villa must again
be given up to Byron and Allegra restored to him.
The cold and rainy weather gave Shelley the idea
of pushing farther south. To feel happy he needed
warmth and sympathy. New climates and new
places might cheat his sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road to Rome wound along among already
reddening vineyards. At every step the travellers
passed teams of cream-coloured oxen of Virgilian
beauty. They went through Ferrara and Bologna,
where they saw such quantities of statues, pictures
and churches that Shelley’s brain became like the
portfolio of an architect or a print-shop or a
commonplace book. Passing by the romantic
cities of Rimini, Spoleto and Terni, they reached
the Campagna di Roma, an absolute solitude, yet
picturesque and charming. When they entered
Rome an immense hawk was sailing in the air
over their heads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The majestic ruins of Rome impressed Shelley
tremendously. The English burying-place, under
the pyramidal tomb of Cestius, appeared to him the
most beautiful and solemn cemetery he had ever
seen. The wind whispered in the leaves of the
trees overhanging tombs which were mostly of
women and young people. If one were to die, it
is there one might desire to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Rome they went on to Naples, where they
took rooms which looked across the Villa
Nazionali to the blue waters of the bay, for ever
changing and for ever the same. Vesuvius was
in a state of eruption, and day and night they
saw volumes of smoke rolling up and fountains of
liquid fire. The black bituminous vapour and the
fiery light were reflected in the sea. The climate
was that of an English spring, though lacking a
little that crescendo of sweetness which delights
one in England when April’s there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went to Pompeii, to Salerno, to Pæstum,
getting exquisite but transitory glimpses, that
leave in the memory dim white visions as of some
half-remembered dream. But, in spite of all this
beauty, they were not happy. They knew no one
and their perpetual loneliness was hard to bear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Basking in the splendid Italian sunshine they
thought with longing of Windsor, of Marlow, even
of London. What was the use of all these mountains,
of all this blue sky without any friends?
Social enjoyment, in some form or other, is the
Alpha and Omega of existence, and, no matter how
real or how beautiful the actual landscape may be,
it dwindles into smoke in the mind when one thinks
of some familiar forms of scenery, commonplace
perhaps in themselves, but over which old
memories throw a delightful hue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the streets they looked with envy at the
workmen and even at the beggars with whom other
workmen and other beggars passed the time of
day. Shelley, who felt himself so full of affection
for mankind, was painfully surprised to find himself
always alone in the midst of multitudes. Mary
disliked particularly being “a foreigner” where-ever
she went. She was at the beginning of a new
pregnancy; Claire got on her nerves insupportably.
She had serious domestic troubles: The
Italian valet, Paolo, had seduced the Swiss nurse.
Mary insisted he should marry her, and when at
last he consented to do so, it was to take his
departure immediately with his wife, vowing
vengeance against Shelley. Next Claire fell ill of
a mysterious malady which Mary misunderstood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Discontented and tired of Naples they decided
to return to Rome. A need of constant change ate
up their tranquillity; they were like a sick man
who for ever seeks a fresher, cooler place in the
bed, and seeks in vain since he takes with him
his fever wherever he moves. The heat of the
southern spring had tired the little boy, “Willmouse,”
his father’s darling. The doctor advised
them to take him northwards immediately to
Lucca. They were on the point of starting when
he was seized with a violent attack of dysentery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During sixty hours, Shelley held the child’s
hand in his; he loved him more and more. Willie
was an affectionate, intelligent and sensitive child.
He had beautiful hair, fair and silky, a transparent
complexion, Shelley’s eyes, blue and animated.
While he slept the Italian maids would come on
tiptoe in to the room to point him out one to the
other. Already in the convulsions of death, the
doctor still hoped to save him. He lived three
days longer and then died at noon on a day of
gorgeous sunshine. He was buried in the
Protestant cemetery which on his first visit to
Rome had so impressed Shelley by its loveliness
and solemn seclusion. The wind was still whispering
in the leaves of the trees. Near an ancient
tomb in the sunny flower-starred grass, Shelley
saw his dead child disappear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fanny .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Harriet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Baby Clara .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
William.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It seemed to him that he was surrounded
by a pestilential atmosphere which
infected one after the other all those he had loved
best.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young couple, whom the gods thus amused
themselves in persecuting, had, so far, bravely
borne the blows. But now Mary gave up the
struggle. Shelley took her away to a pleasant
villa in the country, but she was indifferent to
everything. Always she saw little feet running
over the sands at Naples, heard delicious childish
phrases expressing mingled love and glee.
Motionless, gazing away in a sort of torpor, she
only roused herself to talk of the tomb in Rome.
She wanted for her beautiful boy a block of white
marble, and flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Godwin, hearing of her condition, and using
“the privilege of a father and a philosopher,”
expostulated with her. She was putting herself
quite among “the commonalty and mob of her
sex.” What did she need that she had not? She
possessed the husband of her choice, and all the
goods of fortune, and thereby the means of being
useful to others. “But you have lost a child, and
all the rest of the world, and all that is beautiful,
and all that has a claim upon your kindness is
nothing, because a child of three years old is
dead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley himself gently complained:</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“My dearest Mary, wherefore hast thou gone,</p>
<p class='line'>And left me in this dreary world alone?</p>
<p class='line'>Thy form is here indeed—a lovely one—</p>
<p class='line'>But <span class='it'>thou</span> art fled, gone down the dreary road</p>
<p class='line'>That leads to Sorrow’s most obscure abode.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>As for him, he had his aërial refuges, and once
safely shut therein the lugubrious tragedies of his
life seemed like absurd nightmares. He occupied
himself with <span class='it'>Prometheus</span>, a new presentation of the
one and only theme of his genius: the war of the
Spirit against Matter, the war of Free Man against
the World. In it Jupiter becomes a sort of Lord
Castlereagh, the Titan another Shelley, a victim
filled with hope and confident in the ultimate
triumph of Good. The cloudless skies, the eddyings
of the wild west wind, each and all were a
pretext for singing his faith filled with the
optimism of despair, and which no misfortune
could quell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the moment for Mary’s confinement was
near, they went on to Florence, in order to be
within reach of a good doctor. But the best doctor
was Florence herself, a city in which solitude has
no bitterness. At Florence one lives with Dante;
one sits by the side of Savonarola; one watches
Giotto pass by. In the churches Brunelleschi and
Donatello are still in friendly rivalry. The statues
in the streets live with a more intense life than
anywhere else. On the Piazza di San Miniato,
Michael Angelo’s <span class='it'>David</span> triumphantly challenges
Bandinelli’s silly <span class='it'>Neptune</span> and clumsy <span class='it'>Hercules</span>.
One suffers less from not knowing the children
who play near one, because one possesses the
children of Della Robbia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the hill of San Miniato Shelley loved to
gaze over the city. The red roofs stood out
sharply, the Arno rolled its yellow, rain-swollen
waters between the old houses, which seemed to
huddle along the quays and bridges like a crowd
of human beings; in the distance the valley
touched a horizon of bluish hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the intellectual atmosphere of Florence, Mary
began to take a new interest in life. At the
boarding-house she “mixed a little with the
people downstairs.” She got through the birth-time
quickly and well. When once more she
found herself with a baby in her arms, she smiled
for the first time since the death of William.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had her son christened Percy Florence.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXVIII<br/> <br/> “ANY WIFE TO ANY HUSBAND”</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Everything in life comes in series. One friend
brings another. Mary and Percy, after suffering
so much from loneliness, suddenly found themselves,
without having sought it, the centre of a
gay and pleasant circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chance had worked the miracle. First of all
Shelley had begun to suffer again from the pain in
his side. The wind from the Apennines, so
boisterous in Florence during the winter, tried him
greatly, and the doctor recommended Pisa as more
sheltered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom Medwin, one of his cousins, came to join
him there. Medwin had been in a dragoon regiment
in India, from which he was now retired with
the rank of Captain. He had literary aspirations,
and on this account sought the society of the only
literary member of the family. He was a good
fellow, though a deadly bore, but he introduced to
the Shelleys a charming couple, the Williamses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward Williams, after three years in the Navy,
had exchanged from that branch of the service into
the 8th Dragoon Guards, then quartered in India,
where he had made Medwin’s acquaintance. He
had been obliged to sell out, he always explained,
because of his health. Frank, fearless, quite without
side, and interested in everything, the Shelleys
liked him extremely, and they found his wife
charming. She was a very pretty woman with
much sweetness of manner, and an excellent
musician. The two couples became great friends
and at last the Shelleys knew the delights of
informal visiting, of ungrudging admiration and
praise, and of the perfect confidence which makes
the joy of any real friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment a social circle exists it attracts to
its centre all the lonely souls drifting round its
circumference. Thus, came Taaffe, the Irish
count; Mavrocordato, the Greek prince; and an
extraordinary Italian priest with the diabolic and
piercing eye of a Venetian inquisitor. This was
the reverend professor, Pacchiani, known as the
Devil of Pisa, abbé without religion, professor
without a chair, amateur of women and pictures,
antiquary, pimp, dilettante, and go-between in
general.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Always with some <span class='it'>palazzo</span> or other to let, he
would take his commission from the tenant as well
as from the landlord; he would warmly recommend
a teacher of Italian, and divide with him the
price paid for the lessons; to the rich Englishman
passing through Venice he would give, in strictest
confidence, the address of a <span class='it'>marquese</span> wishing to
sell an Andrea del Sarto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On familiar terms in every house the moment
he had got his foot within the door, he called
Mary and her friend Jane, “la belle Inglese,” and
amused them by telling them tales of the great
ladies of Pisa, to whom he was father confessor
and tame cat.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of Pacchiani’s stories made a deep impression
on Shelley. Count Viviani, a great Florentine
nobleman, had just married, for the second time,
a woman much younger than himself. By his first
wife he had two lovely daughters, and the new
countess, jealous of their beauty, had persuaded
her husband to send them to Pisa and shut them
up each in a separate convent, until husbands were
found who would take them without dowries. The
professor, who had known the <span class='it'>contessine</span> since their
childhood, spoke with enthusiasm of their wit and
beauty. The eldest in particular was almost a
genius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poverina!” said Pacchiani. “She pines
like a bird in a cage. She sees her youth slipping
away unused, and she is made for love. Yesterday
she was watering some flowers in her cell—she
has nothing else to love but her flowers—‘Yes,’
she told them, ‘you were born to vegetate,
but we, thinking beings, we were created for
action and not to wither away in one place.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’
A miserable place too is that convent of St. Anna;
at this moment the poor inmates are shivering
with cold, being allowed nothing to warm them
but a few ashes which they carry about in an
earthen vase. You would pity them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This story reawoke in Shelley all his instincts
of knight-errantry, which the comforts of conjugal
life had stilled during recent years. He asked
dozens of questions, and showed such hot indignation
with the Count, such interest in the fair
victim, that Pacchiani could not resist the pleasure—always
delicious to an old man of his sort—of
bringing two young people together. He offered
to take Shelley to the convent of St. Anna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in all conscience a miserable place, a
ruinous building situated in an unfrequented street
in the suburbs. The visitors crossed a gloomy
portal and the abbé went to find Emilia.
Mephistopheles came back accompanied by Gretchen.
He had not exaggerated her beauty. Her
black hair was tied in a simple knot, after the
manner of a Greek Muse. Her faultless contour
seemed the work of Praxiteles: the marble-like
pallor of her skin made more resplendent her large
black eyes full of a sleepy voluptuousness, in
which certain Italian women surpass even
Orientals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment she appeared in the sombre
parlour, Shelley felt that he loved her, and love
with him was no desire of the flesh, but a need for
self-sacrifice to that which he adored. Ever at the
back of his mind dwelt his ideal of perfect physical
beauty united to perfect spiritual beauty, the myth
of a lovely and persecuted woman whose knight he
would become, some Andromeda to whom he would
play Perseus, some Princess for whom he would
be St. George; a myth which had always been the
motive of his love adventures, which had led him
to run away with Harriet to save her from her
father, and to love Mary because she was
unhappy. It was a sentiment made up in proportions
unknown to himself, of desire and pity,
which earthly perhaps in the beginning, had been
so purified that it now merely raised to the highest
point his creative power in poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Mary he had long believed this mystic love
had been found. She fell indeed as little short of
a goddess as any woman may be. For the first
time, perhaps, the real woman coincided with the
Shelleyan image of her. Nevertheless, daily life
with her had shown him traits quite incompatible
with divinity. Mary, mother of a family and
housekeeper, was a drier, a more practical Mary,
than the loving and courageous young girl of
Skinner Street. What Shelley had been used to
praise as her diamond-like purity now seemed to
him to partake of the coldness of ice, while her
jealousy had become inconceivably petty. Worst
of all, he now knew her too intimately to be able
any longer to find in her a quickening of his ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the beautiful and mysterious Emilia, on the
contrary, he could incarnate his whole soul,
because he knew nothing about her. At long last,
he discovered in this Italian convent, the adorable
and fleeting vision which he had pursued since boyhood,
and which, every time that he had thought
to seize it, had vanished away, leaving him in presence
of a flesh-and-blood woman capable of
wounding his sensitive soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On coming into the parlour, Emilia addressed
herself to a caged bird in terms which appeared
to Shelley the most poetic in the world:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little bird, you are dying of languor!
How I pity you! How much you must suffer
hearing the other birds calling to you, ere they
depart for warmer climes! But you are doomed,
like me, to finish in this prison your miserable
life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah, why can I not free you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was fond of improvising thus in Italian
fashion all sorts of spoken poems that did not fail
in quality—nor in quantity either. But Shelley
saw in her true genius. He begged leave to come
and call upon her again, and to bring with him
his wife and his sister-in-law. She graciously gave
her permission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he described the visit to Mary, he made
no secret of the sentiments with which it had
inspired him. Both of them were great readers
of Plato, and Mary was familiar with that love
which is merely the contemplation of supreme
beauty. She would, however, have been better
pleased to see it awakened by a statue, or that
Shelley, like Dante, had never had the chance of
speaking to his Beatrice. However, when Shelley
begged her to go with him to see the beautiful
prisoner, she willingly went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She admitted that Emilia was beautiful in a
Greek statue style, and of surprising eloquence,
but at the bottom of her heart she felt that she
preferred the chaste reserve of the viaggetory
Englishwoman to this too effusive Italian genius.
She thought that Emilia’s voice was over-loud,
that her gestures, if expressive, were wanting in
grace, and that she was most agreeable when she
held her tongue—which was seldom. However,
Mary was careful not to let her real sentiments
appear on the surface; on the contrary she
expressed for Emilia the warmest friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Claire, more impressionable than Mary, fell,
like Shelley, an immediate victim to Emilia’s
charms. While Mary took the prisoner little
presents, books, a gold chain, Claire, who was
poor, offered the only thing she could give, namely,
lessons in English. Emilia accepted with joy. An
endless correspondence began between the convent
and Pisa, and it was nothing but “Dear
Sister!” “Adored Mary!” “<span class='it'>Sensible</span> Percy!
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>Caro fratello!</span>” and even, in a mystic sense
needless to say, “<span class='it'>Adorato sposo!</span>” Strangely
enough, “dear sister Mary” sometimes showed a
slight coldness. “But your husband tells me that
this apparent coldness is only the ashes which
cover an affectionate heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth is, that Emilia was beginning to get
on dear sister Mary’s nerves, for Shelley was busy
in raising round her one of those aërial worlds into
which he loved to escape. He was writing, in
her honour, a magnificent love-poem, which he
intended to make as mysterious as Dante’s <span class='it'>Vita
Nuova</span>, or the <span class='it'>Sonnets</span> of Shakespeare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although Mary consoled herself by repeating
that all these fine phrases were addressed to the
divine essence of Emilia and not a very pretty
girl with black eyes and black tresses, yet, at the
same time, it was vexing to see Shelley writing
with such enthusiasm. Happily, he was so
engrossed by the ardour of composition that
he had no time to go and see the poem’s heroine.
And while her platonic lover multiplied his
aërial metaphors, Emilia received from the Count,
her father, a cynical message. He had found a
husband who would take her without a penny,
and he requested her to let him know whether
she accepted. The gentleman in question, a
certain Biondi, was not attractive, and he inhabited
a distant castle, surrounded by swamps.
Emilia had never seen him, nor was she to see
him before the wedding-day. Such Turkish
customs were supremely disgusting, yet what
could she do? The Elfin king, married to a
very real Mary, could not, evidently, free her
from her dungeon. Were she to marry Biondi,
this might be perhaps the beginning of a
happier life. And if she didn’t like the man, she
would meet others she might like, for <span class='it'>cavalieri
sirventi</span> are to be found even in the midst of a
swamp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley had not finished his poem before he
learnt that Emilia was married.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six months later Mary wrote to a friend:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Emilia has married Biondi; we hear that she
leads him and his mother—to use a vulgarism—a
devil of a life. The conclusion of our friendship,
<span class='it'>à la Italiana</span>, puts me in mind of a nursery
rhyme which runs thus:</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>‘As I was going down Cranbourne Lane,</p>

<p class='line'>And there I met a pretty maid</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Who dropt to me a curtsy.</p>
<p class='line'>I gave her cakes, I gave her wine,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;I gave her sugar-candy;</p>
<p class='line'>But oh! the little naughty girl,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;She asked me for some brandy.’</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Now turn ‘Cranbourne Lane’ into Pisan
acquaintances, which I am sure are dirty enough,
and ‘brandy’ into the wherewithal to buy
brandy, and you have the whole story of Shelley’s
Italian Platonics.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And Shelley added: “I cannot look at my
poem! The person whom it celebrates was a
cloud instead of a Juno.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think one is
always in love with something or other; the
error—and I confess it is not easy for spirits
cased in flesh and blood to avoid it—consists in
seeking in a mortal image the likeness of what
is, perhaps, eternal.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXIX<br/> <br/> THE CAVALIER’ SIRVENTE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>During the early days which followed her
departure from Venice, Claire had received news
of Allegra fairly often through the Hoppners.
The child suffered from the cold. She had become
quiet and grave as a little old woman. Mr.
Hoppner thought it would be better to remove her
from Venice. But it was impossible to have a
conversation to any purpose with her father who
was sinking deeper and deeper into debauchery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some months went by without any news.
Claire, very anxious, wrote letter after letter to the
Hoppners, who did not reply. Then she learnt
that a great change had taken place in Byron’s
existence. It had begun by his being seriously
ill and obliged to keep his bed. Hoppner, who
came to chat with him, had told him that his
love affairs, far from scandalizing the Venetians
any longer as he believed and hoped, now merely
amused the <span class='it'>conversazioni</span> at his expense. He
was spoken of as the prey of artful trollops who
stole from him, tricked him, and then made
fun of him in their Venetian dialect. Don Juan fell
into a red-hot rage, and instantly all the priestesses
of the Palazzo Mocenigo were turned out of doors,
and sent back, each to her midden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment he was well, he was seen again
at the Venetian receptions, which he had so long
forsaken. Thus he met the beauty of the
season, a lovely blonde, seventeen years of age,
just married to a noble greybeard, the Count
Guiccioli. The Pilgrim admired the lady’s
figure, her bust and arms in particular. The
very first day he slipped into her hand, as he
took leave, a note which she adroitly concealed.
It was an assignation. She came. He who
said he adored her was a great Poet, young,
handsome, highly born, and rich. Though surrounded
by all that makes life desirable, she
instantly gave herself to him without a struggle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days later, the Count took his wife to
Ravenna, and Teresa begged Byron to go too.
“The charmer forgets that a man may be
whistled anywhere <span class='it'>before</span> but that <span class='it'>after</span>—a journey
in an Italian June is a conscription, and
therefore she should have been less liberal in
Venice, or less exigent at Ravenna.” The
notion of romantic and constant love was odious
to him. He did not budge, and was rather
proud of his strength of mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Ravenna she wrote again that she was
very ill, and, where an appeal to love had failed,
an appeal to pity succeeded. Don Juan set
off, but not without stopping at Ferrara and
other towns on the way, to sample the local
beauties. Although making a show of indifference
and even of boredom, he was very glad to
join Teresa. Intelligent women such as Lady
Byron or Claire got on his nerves: he had too
great a contempt for the sex to ask from a mistress
intellectual companionship. The bakers’
wives and other wantons of Venice were of a
species too far below him. But the Countess
Guiccioli united a restful and affectionate
stupidity with the elegance of a well-born woman.
She kept and held without too much trouble this
Everlasting Rover. Don Juan now played the
part of a faithful and devoted sick-nurse.
“Were I to lose her,” he wrote, “I should lose
a being who has run great risks for my sake, and
whom I have every reason to love—but I must
not think this possible. I do not know what I
<span class='it'>should</span> do were she to die, but I ought to blow my
brains out, and I hope that I should.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When his conquering Conquest had to leave
Ravenna for Bologna, he followed. He had
become the classic <span class='it'>cicesbeo</span>: “But I can’t say
I don’t feel the degradation of it. Better to be
an unskilful Planter, an awkward settler, better
to be a hunter, or anything, than a flatterer of
fiddlers and fan carrier of a woman .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
now I am <span class='it'>cavalier’ sirvente</span>! By the holy!
It’s a strange sensation.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Claire was told all this story, and that Byron
had sent orders for Allegra to be brought to
Bologna. The idea that her child was to live in
the house of Byron’s new mistress, who would
have no reasons for loving her and possibly some
for hating her, terrified Claire. She wrote a
passionate letter asking to have her back. Byron
replied:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I disapprove so completely of the way
children are brought up in the Shelley household
that I should think in sending my daughter
to you I was sending her into a hospital. Is
it not so? Have they <span class='it'>reared</span> one?—Either
she will go to England or I shall put her into a
convent. But the child shall not quit me again
to perish of starvation and green fruit, or be
taught to believe that there is no Deity.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On receiving this letter, Claire notes in her
caustic way: “Letter from Albé concerning
green fruit and God”; but she wept over it too.
Allegra in a convent of Italian nuns, who
have no notion of cleanliness and no love for
children, seemed to her a frightful idea. She
sent despairful, violent, almost insolent letters
to Byron, who wrote to complain of her to Shelley,
and to inform him that for the future he should
refuse all correspondence with her.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no conception,” Shelley answered,
“of what Claire’s letters to you contain, and
but an imperfect one on the subject of her correspondence
with you at all. One or two of her
letters, but not lately, I have indeed seen; but
as I thought them extremely childish and absurd,
and requested her not to send them, and she
afterwards told me she had written and sent
others in the place of them, I cannot tell if
those which I saw on that occasion were sent you
or not. I wonder, however, at your being provoked
at what Claire writes, though that she
should write what is provoking is very probable.
You are conscious of performing your duty to
Allegra, and your refusal to allow her to visit
Claire at this distance you consider to be part of
that duty. That Claire should wish to see her
is natural. That her disappointment should
vex her, and her vexation make her write absurdly,
is all in the usual order of things. But, poor
thing, she is very unhappy and in bad health,
and she ought to be treated with as much indulgence
as possible. The weak and the foolish
are in this respect the kings—they can do no
wrong.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>He himself had need of a similar loftiness of
soul, to rise above the women’s quarrels which
distracted his household. Mary grew more
and more short-tempered. Godwin overwhelmed
her with requests for money, to which
Shelley had decided no longer to reply. He
had already given her father nearly five thousand
pounds without any results and had gained, at
this high price, a chastened wisdom and a painful
knowledge of Godwin’s ugly soul. As the
bitter reproaches which the Philosopher now
showered on Mary turned her milk, Shelley
informed him that for the future he would intercept
and suppress all letters likely to upset her:
“Mary has not, nor ought she to have, the disposal
of money. If she had, poor thing, she
would give it all to you. Such a father—I
mean a man of such high genius—can be at no
loss to find subjects on which to address such a
daughter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I need not tell you that the
neglecting entirely to write to your daughter
from the moment that nothing could be gained
by it, would admit of but one interpretation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary, worried about her father, Claire, worried
about her child, got terribly on each other’s
nerves, and their common admiration for the
only man of the household was far more an
obstacle to a good understanding than a help.
Mary did all she knew to make Claire perceive
she was unwanted, and once more Claire as
before had to recognize it. An old lady of the
English colony found her a place as governess in
Florence, Shelley took her thither, and left her
in the family of Professor Bojti.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wrote her long and loving letters, but
though these were quite innocent he did not
show them to Mary, and he asked Claire not to
mention them when she wrote to her sister,
although such a want of frankness was little to
his taste. His early conception of love had
been of a unity of ideas and actions so perfect
that any explanation was quite uncalled for
between lovers. But life had taught him that
perfection is not to be had, and something short
of it must be accepted. There are certain persons
for whom pure Truth is a poison. Mary
could not take it except in very diluted doses.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXX<br/> <br/> A SCANDALOUS LETTER</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>On the 16th September, 1820, R. B. Hoppner
wrote from Venice to Lord Byron:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You are surprised, and with reason,
at the change of my opinion respecting Shiloh;
it certainly is not that which I once entertained
of him; but if I disclose to you my
fearful secret, I trust, for his unfortunate wife’s
sake, if not out of regard to Mrs. Hoppner and
me, that you will not let the Shelleys know that
we are acquainted with it. This request you
will find so reasonable that I am sure you will
comply with it, and I therefore proceed to
divulge to you what indeed on Allegra’s account
it is necessary that you should know, as it will
fortify you in the good resolution you have
already taken never to trust her again to her
mother’s care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must know then that at the time the
Shelleys were here Claire was with child by
Shelley: you may remember to have heard that
she was constantly unwell, and under the care of
a Physician, and I am uncharitable enough to
believe that the quantity of medicine she then
took was not for the mere purpose of restoring
her health. I perceive too why she preferred
remaining alone at Este, notwithstanding her
fear of ghosts and robbers, to being here with
the Shelleys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be this as it may, they proceeded from here
to Naples, where one night Shelley was called
up to see Claire who was very ill. His wife,
naturally, thought it very strange that he should
be sent for; but although she was not aware of
the nature of the connection between them she
had had sufficient proof of Shelley’s indifference,
and of Claire’s hatred for her: besides as Shelley
desired her to remain quiet she did not dare to
interfere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Mid-wife was sent for, and the worthy
pair, who had made no preparation for the reception
of the unfortunate being she was bringing
into the world, bribed the woman to carry it
to the Pieta, where the child was taken half an
hour after its birth, being obliged likewise to
purchase the physician’s silence with a considerable
sum. During all the time of her confinement
Mrs. Shelley, who expressed great anxiety
on her account, was not allowed to approach
her, and these beasts, instead of requiting her
uneasiness on Claire’s account by at least a few
expressions of kindness, have since increased in
their hatred of her, behaving to her in the most
brutal manner, and Claire doing everything she
can to engage her husband to abandon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Mrs. Shelley, whatever suspicions she
may entertain of the nature of their connection,
knows nothing of their adventure at Naples,
and as the knowledge of it could only add to her
misery, ’tis as well that she should not. This
account we had from Elise, who passed here
this summer with an English lady who spoke
very highly of her. She likewise told us that
Claire does not scruple to tell Mrs. Shelley that
she wishes her dead, and to say to Shelley in her
presence that she wonders how he can live with
such a creature.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think after this account you will no longer
wonder that I have a bad opinion of Shelley.
His talents I acknowledge, but I cannot concur
that a man can be as you say ‘crazy against
morality’ and have honour. I have heard of
honour among thieves, but there it means only
interest, and though it may be to Shelley’s
interest to cut as respectable a figure as he can
with the opinions he publickly professes, it is
clear to me that honour does not direct any one
of his actions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear my letter is written in a very incoherent

<div><span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXXI<br/> <br/> LORD BYRON’S SILENCE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley, invited by Lord Byron to come to
Ravenna so that they might discuss important
matters, found the Pilgrim in brilliant fettle. He
looked in splendid health; for the reign of the
Guiccioli had rescued him from the degrading
libertinage of Venice. Fletcher himself had
grown fatter, as the shadow increases in proportion
with the body which throws it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Palazzo Guiccioli was a splendid affair,
the household mounted on a royal scale. On
the marble staircase Shelley met with every kind
of animal making himself at home. Eight enormous
dogs, three monkeys, five cats, an eagle, a
parrot, and a falcon quarrelled together and made
it up as it suited them. There were ten horses in
the stables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byron welcomed him with great friendliness,
and the night was passed in reading and discussing
Byron’s poems. The new cantos of
<span class='it'>Don Juan</span> appeared admirable to Shelley. His
contact with Byron’s genius always reduced him
to despair. Beside the solid structure of Byron’s
verse, his own seemed strangely fragile. He
told Byron he ought to write a poem which would
be for his time what the <span class='it'>Iliad</span> was for the Greeks.
But Byron affected to despise posterity, and to
take no interest in poetry except at a thousand
guineas the canto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again Shelley, the Ascetic, was obliged
to adapt himself to the habits and customs of
Byron the Magnificent. They got up at mid-day,
they breakfasted at two, and worked until
six in the evening. They rode from six to eight,
dined, and spent the night talking until six
o’clock next morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byron did not talk merely of poetry. From
the very first day, and with the most friendly air
in the world, he posted Shelley up in the scandalous
stories circulating about him amongst the
English in Italy. In spite of having promised
the Hoppners not to give them away, he showed
Shelley the letter containing the calumnies of
Elise. He declared, of course, that he had
never given the smallest credence to the ridiculous
tale, but that the Hoppners should have
been so ready to believe it was to Shelley a
heart-breaking blow. He wrote immediately to
Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord Byron has told me of a circumstance
that shocks me exceedingly, because it exhibits
a degree of desperate and wicked malice, for
which I am at a loss to account. When I hear
such things, my patience and my philosophy are
put to a severe proof, whilst I refrain from seeking
out some obscure hiding place, where the
countenance of man may never meet me more.
It seems that Elise, actuated either by some
inconceivable malice for our dismissing her, or
bribed by my enemies, or making common cause
with her infamous husband, has persuaded the
Hoppners of a story so monstrous and incredible
that they must have been prone to believe any
evil to have believed such assertions upon such
evidence. Mr. Hoppner wrote to Lord Byron
to state this story as the reason why he declined
any further communications with us, and why
he advised him to do the same. Elise says that
Claire was my mistress; that is very well, and
so far there is nothing new; all the world has
heard so much, and people may believe or not
believe as they think good. She then proceeds
to say that Claire was with child by me; that I
gave her most violent medicine to procure abortion;
that this not succeeding she was brought
to bed, and that I immediately tore the child
from her and sent it to the Foundling Hospital—I
quote Mr. Hoppner’s words—and this is
stated to have taken place in the winter after
we left Este. In addition, she says that I treated
<span class='it'>you</span> in the most shameful manner; that I
neglected and beat you, and that Claire never
let a day pass without offering you insults of
the most violent kind, in which she was abetted
by me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As to what Reviews and the world says,
I do not care a jot, but when persons who have
known me are capable of conceiving of me—not
that I have fallen into a great error, as would
have been the living with Claire as my mistress—but
that I have committed such unutterable
crimes as destroying or abandoning a child, and
that my own! Imagine my despair of good!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Imagine how it is possible that one of so
weak and sensitive a nature can run further the
gauntlet through this hellish society of men!
<span class='it'>You</span> should write to the Hoppners a letter
refuting the charge, in case you believe, and
know, and can prove that it is false, stating the
grounds and proofs of your belief. I need not
dictate what you should say, nor, I hope, inspire
you with warmth to rebut a charge which you
only can effectually rebut. If you will send
the letter to me here, I will forward it to the
Hoppners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After a silence of nearly two years, I address
you again, and most bitterly do I regret the
occasion on which I now write.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I write to defend him to whom I have the
happiness to be united, whom I love and esteem
beyond all living creatures, from the foulest
calumnies; and to you I write this, who were
so kind, and to Mr. Hoppner, to both of whom
I indulged the pleasing idea that I have every
reason to feel gratitude. This is indeed a painful
task. Shelley is at present on a visit to
Lord Byron at Ravenna, and I received a letter
from him to-day, containing accounts that make
my hand tremble so much that I can hardly hold
the pen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says Claire was Shelley’s mistress, that
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Upon my word, I solemnly assure you
that I cannot write the words. I send you a
part of Shelley’s letter that you may see what I
am now about to refute, but I had rather die
than copy anything so vilely, so wickedly false,
so beyond all imagination fiendish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that you should believe it! That my
beloved Shelley should stand thus slandered in
your minds—he, the gentlest and most humane
of creatures—is more painful to me than words
can express. Need I say that the union between
my husband and myself has ever been undisturbed?
Love caused our first imprudence—love
which, improved by esteem, a perfect trust
one in the other, has increased daily and knows
no bounds.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those who know me well believe my simple
word—it is not long ago that my father said, in a
letter to me, that he had never known me utter
a falsehood—but you, easy as you have been to
credit evil, who may be more deaf to truth—to
you I swear by all that I hold sacred upon heaven
and earth, by a vow which I should die to write
if I affirmed a falsehood—I swear by the life of
my child, by my blessed beloved child, that I
know the accusation to be false. But I have
said enough to convince you, and you are not
convinced? Repair, I conjure you, the evil you
have done by retracting your confidence in one
so vile as Elise, and by writing to me that you
now reject as false every circumstance of her
infamous tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were kind to us, and I will never forget
it; now I require justice. You must believe
me, and do me, I solemnly entreat you, the justice
to confess that you do so.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley showed this letter to Byron and asked
for the address of Hoppner, but Byron begged
to be allowed to send it himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Hoppners,” he said, “had extracted a
promise from me not to speak to you of this
affair; in openly confessing that I have not
kept my promise I must observe some form.
That is why I wish to send the letter myself.
My observations, besides, will give more weight
to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley readily consented and gave the letter
to his host. Mary never received an answer.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>The important question that Byron wished
to discuss with Shelley was the fate of Allegra
in case he—Byron—should leave Ravenna.
Countess Guiccioli wished to go to Switzerland;
Byron, who preferred Tuscany, begged Shelley
to write to the Countess to describe life in Florence
and Pisa in such attractive fashion that she
would agree to go to one or the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley had never seen his friend’s mistress,
but he was so used to be asked to intervene in
the affairs of his acquaintance that he did not
hesitate to write the letter asked, and it was so
vigorous that it carried the day. It was suddenly
decided that Byron and the Countess
should join the Shelleys at Pisa. As to Allegra,
Byron agreed to take her also. Claire not being
there, he saw no reason for not doing so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before leaving Ravenna, Shelley went to see
the child at the Convent of Bagna-Cavallo. He
found her taller, but also more delicate and
paler. Her lovely black hair fell in curls over
her shoulders. She appeared in the midst of
her companions as a being of a finer and nobler
race. A kind of contemplative seriousness
seemed to overlie her former vivacity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was shy at first, but Shelley having given
her a gold chain which he brought from Ravenna,
she became more friendly. She led him to the
convent garden, running and skipping so quickly
that he could scarcely follow her; she showed
him her little bed, her chair. He asked her
what he should say to her mama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Che mi manda un baccio e un bel vestituro.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“E come voi il vestituro sia fatto?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tutte di seta e d’oro.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And to her father:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Che venga farmi un visitino e che porta
seco la mammina.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A difficult message to transmit to her noble
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dominant trait of the child seemed to
Shelley to be vanity. Her education was defective,
but she could recite a great many prayers
by heart, spoke of Paradise, dreamed of it, and
knew long lists of saints. This was the sort of
training that Byron desired.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXXII<br/> <br/> MIRANDA</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Great excitement such as travelling royalties always
arouse reigned in the Pisan circle at the expected
arrival of the Pilgrim. Mary, at Shelley’s request,
had taken for him the Palazzo Lanfranchi, stateliest
on the Lung’ Arno. Helped by the Williamses, she
had done what she could to put this ancient
palace in order. The vanguard arrived in the
persons of the Guiccioli and her father, Count
Gamba; the Shelleys gave them a cordial welcome.
The Countess was an agreeable surprise. “She is
a very pretty, sentimental, innocent Italian,”
Shelley wrote, “who, if I know anything of human
nature and my Byron, will hereafter have plenty
of opportunity to repent her rashness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Don Juan himself followed, all Pisa was
at the windows to see the English Devil and his
menagerie. The procession was well worth seeing;
five carriages, six men-servants, nine horses, dogs,
monkeys, peacocks, and ibises, all in line. The
Shelleys were a little anxious as to what Byron
would think of the palazzo, but fortunately it
pleased him. He said he liked these old places
dating back to the Middle Ages. In reality it dated
to the sixteenth century, and was said to have been
built from designs by Michael Angelo, but the noble
lord always mixed up hopelessly architectural
styles. The dark and damp cellars in particular
delighted him. He spoke of them as dungeons and
subterranean cells, and had cushions taken down
so that he might sleep there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He became at once the social centre of the Pisan
circle, while Shelley remained its moral centre.
Byron was visited from curiosity and admiration;
Shelley from sympathy. Shelley got up early and
read Goethe, Spinoza or Calderon until midday; then
he was off to the pine-woods, where he worked in
solitude until evening. Byron got up at midday and,
after a light breakfast, went for a ride, or to practise
pistol-shooting. In the evening he visited the Guiccioli,
and coming home at eleven, would often work
until two or three in the morning. Then in a state
of feverish cerebral excitement, he would go to bed,
sleep badly, and remain in bed half the following day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English in Pisa made a dead set at him.
Even the most Puritan amongst them could not be
severe on an authentic lord who brought to them
on foreign soil so delightful an epitome of London’s
Vanity Fair. The pleasure he took in giving scandal,
what was it but a mark of orthodox respect? If
indifference is justly considered an offence, surely
defiance must be accepted as a token of humility?
And was it not patent that he could not exist without
going into society, paying court to women,
accepting dinners and returning them? He met
with the greatest indulgence. But when he tried
to win the same for Shelley, the resistance was
thoroughly British. In society Shelley was bored
and did not hide it. In questions of morality it was
easy to guess that he put the Spirit before the
Letter, that he believed in Redemption rather than
in Original Sin. Faith in the perfectibility of man
is naturally the most heinous of crimes, since if
believed in, it would force one to work for man’s
perfectibility. The mere smell of it makes society
fly to arms for its destruction. All “nice” women
treated the Shelleys as pariahs and outcasts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley laughed at this, preferring a thousand
times the cool fresh air of night to the hot and
smoky atmosphere of card-rooms. But Mary
hankered to go everywhere. There was a certain
Mrs. Beauclerc, gayest of English ladies in Pisa,
who gave balls, “being afflicted,” as Byron said,
“with a litter of seven daughters all at the age when
these animals are obliged to waltz for their livelihood.”
Mary’s fixed idea was to be invited to one
of these balls. “Everybody goes to them,” she
said. Shelley, distressed, looked up at the sky,
“Everybody! Who is this mythical monster?
Have you ever seen it, Mary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To win the favour of “everybody” she even went
to Church Service, but the parson preached against
Atheists, and kept looking at her in such a marked
manner that, in spite of her desire to conform, her
dignity as a wife prevented her from ever going again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these social worries, balls and dinner parties,
seemed to Shelley of an incredible vulgarity. When
he was a boy of twenty, he had judged fashionable
life as criminal, now it appeared to him contemptible,
which was much more serious. To escape
from Mary’s absurd reproaches and regrets, he
would take refuge with the Williamses. There he
found anew the harmonious and affectionate atmosphere
that was essential to him. Edward Williams
had a gay, generous nature in which there was
nothing petty. Jane’s grace and sweetness, the
gentleness of her movements, the soothing beauty
of her voice, were as reposeful and pleasant as some
delightful garden. Perhaps in his youth she would
have pleased Shelley less. Then he dreamed always
of heroic qualities in women, but to-day he asked
from them the gift of forgetfulness rather than
courage and strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane sang, and her voice carried him momentarily
away from his tragic memories, and the
chilly rectitude of his home. Just as formerly, when
Harriet wounded him, and he read in Mary’s eyes
all the consolation they promised him, so now he
contemplated in Jane’s an image of the Antigone
whom he had surely known and loved in a previous
existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he no longer considered it necessary to
destroy in order to rebuild, to abandon Mary in
order to fly with Jane. She was married to a good
fellow, whose friend he wished loyally to remain,
and it was necessary also to consider the feelings
of Mary, poor unhappy woman. He was in love
with Jane, but it was an immaterial love, without
hope, and almost without desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lent herself cleverly to the romantic business,
would pass her hand through his hair, smooth his
forehead, try to cure his sadness by her personal
magnetism. She and her husband were as a marvellous
fountain of friendship, at which a poet, weary
of suffering, could cool his fever. Jane and Edward
were Ferdinand and Miranda, the splendid,
princely couple, and Shelley was their faithful
Ariel.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Round the happy lovers flitted
a captive and guardian Spirit serving their will
and doing his spiriting gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Williamses had often spoken to Shelley of
one of their friends, Trelawny, an extraordinary
man, corsair and pirate, who at twenty-eight had
already led a life of adventure all the world over, on
land as well as on sea. He now desired ardently to
be admitted to the Pisa circle, and he overwhelmed
the Williamses with letters: “If I come, shall I be
able to know Shelley? Above all, shall I be able to
know Byron? Is it possible to approach him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Williams, in daily intercourse with the two Poets,
no longer held them in any awe, so he replied with
a touch of impatience, “Of course you will see
them. Shelley is the simplest of men.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As to
Byron, that will depend entirely on yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trelawny reached Pisa late one evening and
went at once to the Tre Palazzi on the Lung’ Arno
where the Williamses and the Shelleys lived on
different stories under the same roof. He and the
Williamses were in animated conversation when he
perceived in the passage near the open door a pair
of glittering eyes steadily fixed on his. Jane going
to the doorway laughingly said, “Come in,
Shelley, it’s only our friend Tre just arrived.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley glided in, blushing like a girl, and holding
out his two hands gave the sailor’s a warm
pressure. Trelawny looked at him with surprise.
It was hard to believe that this flushed and artless
face could be that of the genius and rebel, reviled
as a monster in England, and whom the Lord
Chancellor had deprived of his rights as a father.
Shelley, on his side, admired Trelawny’s bold, wild
face, raven-black moustache, handsome half-Arab
type. Both of them were so astounded they could find
nothing to say. To relieve their embarrassment
Jane asked Shelley what book he had in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face brightened and he answered briskly:
“Calderon’s <span class='it'>Magico Prodigioso</span>. I am translating
some passages in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, read it to us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately Shelley, shoved off from the shore
of commonplace incidents that could not interest
him, began to translate from the open book, in so
masterly a manner with such perfection of form
that Trelawny no longer doubted his identity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dead silence followed the reading. Trelawny
looked up and seeing no one asked, “Where is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?” said Jane. “Shelley? Oh, he comes and
goes like a spirit no one knows when or where.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day it was Shelley himself who took
Trelawny to call on Byron. Here the surroundings
were very different. A large marble hall, a giant
staircase, powdered footmen and surly dogs. Trelawny,
like every one else, saw in Byron’s external
appearance all the traits with which imagination
endows genius, but the great man’s conversation
struck him as commonplace. He seemed too to be
playing a part, and an out-of-date one—that of a
rake-hell of the Regency. He told stories about
actors, boxers and hard-drinkers, and of how he
had swum the Hellespont. Of this exploit he was
very proud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At three the horses were brought round. After
riding for a couple of hours, the party dismounted
at a small <span class='it'>podere</span>, pistols were sent for, a cane was
stuck into the ground behind the house and a piece
of money placed in a slit at the top of the cane.
Byron, Shelley and Trelawny fired at fifteen paces,
and their firing was pretty equal. Each time the
cane or the coin was hit by one or the other. Trelawny
was pleased to see that despite his feminine
appearance, Shelley could hold his own with men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the way back they talked poetry, and Trelawny
cited a couplet from <span class='it'>Don Juan</span> as an example
of felicitous rhyming. Byron, won over, brought
his horse round to trot beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confess now,” said he, “you expected to find
me a Timon of Athens or a Timur the Tartar, and
you’re surprised to find a man of the world—never
in earnest—laughing at all things mundane?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he muttered as to himself:</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“The world is a bundle of hay,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Mankind are the asses who pull.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trelawny returned with Shelley and Mary.
“How different Byron is to anything one expects
of him!” said he. “There’s no mystery about
him at all. On the contrary he talks too freely,
and says things he had much better not say. He
seems as jealous and impulsive as a woman, and
maybe is more dangerous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary,” said Shelley, “Trelawny has found
out Byron already. How stupid we were—how long
it took us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The reason is,” said Mary, “that Trelawny
lives with the living, and we live with the dead.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXXIII<br/> <br/> THE DISCIPLES</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The sailor who had come to Pisa to admire
two great men found that it was he, on
the contrary, who was admired by them. It is
true that when Trelawny was absent, Byron
said of him: “If we could get him to wash
his hands and not to tell lies, we might make a
gentleman of him,” but when he was present
Byron treated him with the greatest respect.
Like all artists, Byron and Shelley wrote in order
to console themselves for not living, and a man
of action appeared to these two men of dreams
as a strange and enviable phenomenon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley consulted Trelawny as to nautical
terms, and drew with him, on the sandy shores
of the Arno, keels, sails, and sea-charts. “I’ve
missed my vocation,” said he. “I ought to have
been a sailor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man who neither smokes nor swears can
never be a sailor,” Trelawny told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byron, an imaginary corsair, would have liked
to learn from a real corsair the ways and customs
of the brotherhood, and did his utmost in Trelawny’s
company to talk in cynical and bravado
fashion. Trelawny, quick to perceive his influence
over Byron, tried to make use of it in
the service of Shelley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” said he as they rode together
one day, “that you might help Shelley a good
deal at small cost by a friendly word or two in
your next work, such as you have given to other
writers of much less merit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All trades have their secrets,” Byron
answered. “If we crack up a popular author,
he repays us in the same coin, capital and interest.
But Shelley! A bad investment.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Who
reads the Snake? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Besides, if he cast off
the slough of his mystifying metaphysics, he
would want no puffing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why do your London friends treat him
so cavalierly? They rarely notice him when
they meet him at your place. Yet he is as well-born
and bred as any of them. What are they
afraid of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byron smiled and whispered in Trelawny’s
ear:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shelley is not a Christian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I met the Devil at your table,” said
Trelawny, “I should treat him as a friend of
yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Pilgrim looked at him keenly to see if
there were a double meaning, then moving his
horse up nearer said in a low voice of admirably
acted fear and respect:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Devil is a Royal Personage.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the Williamses, Trelawny was more
outspoken. The three of them formed the
chorus to the tragedy; knowing they were not
made for the chief parts, they took pleasure in
commenting the acting of those who were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One might imagine,” said Trelawny, “that
Byron is jealous of Shelley. Yet Murray is
obliged to call on the police to protect his premises
every time he publishes a new canto of
<span class='it'>Childe Harold</span>, while poor Shelley hasn’t got
ten readers. Byron has high birth, riches,
beauty, glory, love .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Williams interrupted, “but Byron is
the slave to his passions and to any woman who
is at all decided. Shelley in his nutshell of a
boat floats in mid-stream on the Arno, and refuses
to let it carry him away. His ideas are well-grounded,
he holds a doctrine. Byron is incapable
of holding one for two consecutive hours.
He is well aware of this, and can’t forgive himself
for it. You see it in the triumphant tone in
which he speaks of Shelley’s misfortunes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Byron,” said Jane, “is a spoiled child, but
neither he nor Shelley understands men. Shelley
loves them too much, and Byron not enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s so terrible about Shelley,” said
Trelawny, “is that he has not the smallest
instinct of self-preservation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The other
day when I was diving in the Arno, he said he
so much regretted not being able to swim.
‘Try,’ said I. ‘Put yourself on your back,
and you’ll float to begin with.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He stripped and jumped in without the
smallest hesitation. He sank to the bottom and
lay there like a conger-eel, not making the least
movement to save himself. He would have
drowned if I had not instantly fished him out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane sighed, knowing how much the thought
of suicide haunted Shelley’s mind. He often
repeated that nearly every one he had loved had
died in this way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet he doesn’t seem unhappy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, because he lives in his dreams. But
in real life don’t you think he suffers from the
impossibility of spreading his ideas, from his
books that don’t sell, from his unhappy home
life? Death must often appear to him like the
awakening from a nightmare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He believes in a future life,” said Trelawny.
“Those who call him an Atheist don’t know
him. He has often told me that he thinks the
French philosophy of the eighteenth century
false and pernicious. Plato and Dante have
overcome Diderot for him. All the same he
doesn’t regret his attitude towards established
religion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘Why,’ I asked him, ‘do you
call yourself an Atheist? It annihilates your
chances in this world.’ ‘It is a word of abuse,’
said he, ‘to stop discussion, a painted Devil to
frighten fools. I used it to express my abhorrence
of superstition. I took it up as a knight
takes up a gauntlet, in defiance of injustice. The
delusions of Christianity are fatal to genius and
originality; they limit thought.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus spoke the chorus in unanimity, and did
not perhaps perceive that their adoration of
Shelley fed and grew on his misfortunes. We
are more inclined to love that which we can pity
than that which we must admire. Man finds in
the spectacle of unmerited failure flattering arguments
which explain his own ill-luck. The blend
of admiration and compassion is one of the surest
recipes for love. It would have needed much
humility of mind for Williams and Trelawny to
have the same affection for the brilliant Byron that
they had for poor dear Shelley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the disciples discoursed in this fashion,
the Master worked in the pine-woods outside
Pisa. There the sea-winds had thrown down one
of the pines, which now hung suspended over
a deep pool of glimmering water. Under the lee
of the trunk, and nearly hidden, sat the Poet like
some wild thing, the way to his retreat pointed
out by quantities of scattered papers, covered with
the scrawls of unfinished poems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When in his day-dreaming he forgot everything,
even the dinner hour, Mary and Trelawny
would go off to find him. Tre had constituted
himself <span class='it'>cavalier’ sirvente</span> to the forsaken lady, and
paid her court in corsair fashion which she, in her
honest woman-way, found very amusing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The loose sand and hot sun soon knocked her
up. She sat down under the cool canopy of the
pines and Trelawny continued the Poet-chase
alone. He found him at last, but so absorbed
by some inner vision, that to avoid startling him,
Trelawny drew his attention first by the crackling
of the pine-needles. He picked up an Æschylus,
a Shakespeare, then a scribbled paper: “To
Jane with a guitar”: but he could only make
out the two first lines:</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“Ariel to Miranda. Take</p>
<p class='line'>This slave of music.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He hailed him, and Shelley, turning his head,
answered faintly, “Hello! Come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this your study?” Trelawny asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he answered, “and these trees are my
books—they tell no lies. In composing, one’s
faculties must not be divided: in a house there is
no solitude: a door shutting, a footstep heard, a
bell ringing, a voice, causes an echo in your brain,
and dissolves your visions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here you have the river rushing by you, the
birds chattering .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The river flows by like Time, and all the
sounds of Nature harmonize.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is only the
human animal that is discordant and disturbs me.
Oh, how difficult it is to know why we are here,
a perpetual torment to ourselves and to every
living thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trelawny interrupted to tell him that his wife
was waiting for him at the edge of the wood.
He started up, snatched up his scattered books
and papers and thrust them into his hat and
jacket pockets, sighing, “Poor Mary! hers is a
sad fate. She can’t bear solitude, nor I society—the
quick coupled with the dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began to proffer excuses to her, but she,
either to hide her emotions or form a Godwinesque
lack of any, began in a bantering tone: “What
a wild goose you are, Percy! If my thoughts
have strayed from my book, it was to the Opera,
and my new dress from Florence, and especially
to the ivy wreath so much admired for my hair,
and not to you, you silly fellow! When I left
home my satin slippers had not arrived. These
are serious matters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in Mary’s pleasantries there was always a
note which rang false.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXXIV<br/> <br/> II SAMUEL XII. 23</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Byron, after promising Shelley to bring Allegra
to Pisa, arrived without her, and Claire, who had
come expressly from Florence to wait about the
city in the hopes of seeing the child, was horribly
alarmed on learning she had been left in the convent
of Bagna-Cavallo. Her Italian friends gave
her a sinister description of this convent, set down
in the middle of the marshes of the Romagna, and
in the most unhealthy climate. The nuns—Capucins—ignored
hygiene, fed the children disgracefully,
and did not warm them at all. Claire
could not see a fire without thinking of her poor
little darling who never saw or felt a cheerful
blaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This high-spirited young woman was brought,
through maternal anguish, to an abnegation that
was sublime. She wrote to Byron that she would
renounce ever seeing Allegra again so long as she
lived, if he would consent to put her in a good
English School. “I can no longer resist,” she
said, “the internal inexplicable feeling which
haunts me that I shall never see her any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byron made no reply. There was some talk
amongst Claire’s friends of rescuing Allegra by
stratagem, but Shelley begged her to have
patience. While agreeing with her as to Byron’s
cruelty, he disapproved of thoughtless violence.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Lord Byron is inflexible and you are in his
power. Remember, Claire, when you rejected my
earnest advice, and checked me with that contempt
which I had never merited from you at
Milan and how vain is now your regret! This is
the second of my sibylline volumes. If you wait for
the third, it may be sold at a still higher price.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He called upon Byron to plead Claire’s cause,
but the moment Byron heard her name he gave an
impatient shrug of the shoulders. “Oh, women
can’t exist without making scenes!” Shelley
told him what Claire had heard about the unsuitability
of the convent. “What do I know about
it?” he said. “I have never been there.” Then,
when Claire’s anguish and her fears were described
to him, a smile of malicious satisfaction passed over
his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had difficulty in restraining myself from
knocking him down,” said Shelley afterwards at
Lady Mountcashell’s. “I was furious but I was
wrong. He can no more help being what he is
than that door can help being a door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But old Mr. Tighe told him, “You are quite
wrong in your fatalism. If I were to horsewhip
that door it would still remain a door, but if Lord
Byron were well horsewhipped my opinion is he
would become as humane as he is now inhumane.
It’s the subserviency of his friends that makes him
the insolent tyrant he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On hearing of Shelley’s failure, Claire fell into
such despair that Mary and Shelley would not
allow her to return to Florence alone amongst
strangers. They were going to spend the summer
at the sea with the Williamses and they invited her
to go with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley looked forward with eagerness to this
plan. Williams and he had consulted Trelawny
about a boat, and he was having one built for
them at Genoa by Captain Roberts, a friend of his.
They had already christened her the <span class='it'>Don Juan</span> in
honour of Byron, who had also commissioned
Roberts to build him a schooner with a covered-in
deck; the <span class='it'>Bolivar</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley and Williams saw themselves masters
of the Mediterranean. Their wives were less
enthusiastic. While the two young men drew
charts of the bay upon the sand, Mary and Jane
walked together, philosophized, and picked violets
by the road-side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate this boat!” said Mary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” Jane agreed. “But it’s no use
saying anything, it would do no good and merely
spoil their pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So as to put their projects into action, two houses
were necessary at the seaside. They thought of
the Bay of Spezzia. Shelley and Williams hunted
for these houses along its shores in vain. Lord
Byron, who wished to join them, must have a
palazzo, but he was obliged to give up the idea
at once, since even two fishermen’s houses were
not to be had. Williams and his wife determined
to make one last search; to distract Claire from
her troubles they took her with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had left Pisa but a few hours when Lord
Byron wrote to Shelley that he had received bad
news of Allegra. An epidemic of typhus had
broken out in the Romagna. The nuns had taken
no preventative measures. The child, already
weak and tired, had caught the fever. She was
dead. “I do not know,” he added, “that I have
anything to reproach in my conduct and certainly
nothing in my feelings and intentions towards the
dead. But it is a moment when we are apt to
think that, if this or that had been done such events
might have been prevented—though every day and
hour shows us that they are the most natural and
inevitable. I suppose that Time will do his usual
work—Death has done his.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Shelleys went to call on him. He was
paler than usual, but as calm as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days later the Williamses and Claire came
back from their expedition. Shelley, fearing some
act of violence on her part if she were told of her
misfortune while in Byron’s neighbourhood,
resolved to say nothing to her so long as they
remained in Pisa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Williams had not found the two furnished
houses he sought. Along the entire coast there
was but one house to let, a big unfurnished and
abandoned building known as the Casa Magni at
Lerici, with a veranda facing the sea and almost
over it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley, who desired above all things to get
Claire out of Pisa, decided to take the Casa Magni.
The two households must live together. Inconvenient?
That didn’t matter. No furniture?
Furniture could be sent from Pisa. When Shelley
was really determined on a thing, nothing could
resist him. “I go forward,” said he, “until I
am stopped. But nothing ever does stop me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Custom House officials, the boatmen, raised
scores of difficulties. Shelley brushed them aside
by the sheer force of a will-power that takes no
notice of the outside world, and in a few days the
two families were settled in at the seaside.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Casa Magni has been a Jesuit convent. It was
a white house standing almost in the sea, and
backing against a forest. A terrace, supported on
arches, overhung the superb Bay of Spezzia. The
ground floor was unpaved and uninhabitable, being
reached by the waves when the sea was rough.
It was used simply for storing boat-gear and fishing
tackle. The single storey over this was divided
into a large hall or saloon, and four small bedrooms
which opened from it: two for Shelley and
Mary, one for the Williamses and one for Claire.
The accommodation was scanty, and the first
evening depressing. Down below the waves beat
against the rocks with a mournful persistency. The
Williamses and Shelleys could think of nothing but
Claire, and she, with no idea of the dreadful truth,
imagined they were annoyed at having her there
with them in a house which was obviously too
small. She said so, and offered to go back to
Florence. Every one cried out against this. Jane
whispered something to Mary, and the two withdrew
to the Williamses’ room. Shelley joined
them. Claire went towards the room after a
moment or two: she found them in eager conversation
which instantly ceased as they saw her.
Then before a single word had been uttered, she
said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Allegra is dead?”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next day she wrote Byron a terrible letter,
which he returned to Shelley complaining of
Claire’s harshness towards him, and begging
Shelley to let her know he would allow her to make
any arrangements she liked for the burial of their
child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She replied with a sombre irony that for the
future she left everything to him, and that all she
asked was a portrait of Allegra and a piece of her
hair. Byron became surprisingly pliable, sent
almost at once a very pretty miniature and a dark
curl. Claire took leave of her friends at Casa
Magni, and went back to Florence to live amongst
strangers, who, knowing nothing of her grief,
could do nothing to revive it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byron decided to have his daughter buried in
England, in the church of Harrow-on-the-Hill,
where he had been at school, and to place on the
wall above the grave a marble tablet with the
words:</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>To the Memory of Allegra</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>Daughter of George Gordon Lord Byron</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>Died at Bagna-Cavallo, the 20th April, 1822.</span></p>
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>Aged five years and six months.</span></p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->


          <div class='literal-container-right' style='margin-bottom:1em;'>
          <div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>I shall go to her, but she</p>
<p class='line'>shall not return to me.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>II Sam. xii. 23.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>But the Rector of Harrow and the church-wardens
considered it immoral to admit into their
church the body of an illegitimate child, more particularly
if the epitaph disclosed the name of the
father. Allegra was therefore buried outside the
church, and with no inscription, which was of
course the proper thing to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Byron, who had never set foot inside the
convent of Bagna-Cavallo while Allegra was alive,
went to visit it some time after the child’s death,
for now his regrets lent it a romantic and sentimental
interest, inspired him with a fine meditation
on death and on himself: “I shall go to her,
but she shall not return to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second Samuel was quite right.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXXV<br/> <br/> THE REFUGE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley was charmed with Casa Magni. He liked
the wild solitude of the place, the forest behind
the house, the rocky and wooded bays and the
fisherman’s poor villages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mary felt lost and unhappy. Again pregnant,
anxious, irritable, she would have much preferred
to live in a city near a good doctor. She thought
the peasantry uncouth and hateful, their <span class='it'>Genovese</span>
jargon disgusted her as much as the dialect of
Tuscany had pleased her. The presence of Jane
Williams, so appreciated by her at Pisa, began to
get on her nerves. Housekeeping in common is for
women the acid test. There were stupid quarrels
over servants and frying pans. Shelley spoke too
warmly of Jane’s perfection, and wrote her too
divine serenades.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To all Mary’s grumblings he replied with his
usual sweetness. With the utmost tenderness he
caressed and consoled her. “Poor Mary,” he said
of her, “it is the curse of Tantalus to be endowed
with such fine qualities, and yet unable to excite
the sympathy indispensable to their application to
domestic life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew he could not change her, that her
physical condition explained a good deal of her
peevishness, which he bore with patient affection.
What she constantly reproached him with was his
complete indifference to the things that other men
thought worth while. She still admired him as
much as ever, in him alone she found the strength
on which to lean. But why could he never use this
strength to his own advantage? He seemed to
have no notion of his own interests. His personality
was not in his own eyes what theirs is for
men in general, something strictly limited by
definite boundaries; no, his poured outwards in a
sort of luminous fringe melting into that of his
friends, and even into that of perfect strangers.
As to the customs and cares of human societies
he continued to ignore them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every month he went to Leghorn to draw his
allowance. He brought back a bagful of <span class='it'>scudi</span>
which he emptied out upon the floor. Then with
the fire-shovel he gathered the coins together in a
heap, which he flattened out into a sort of cake
with his foot. Always with the shovel he cut the
cake into two parts. One was for Mary: rent and
housekeeping. The other half was again divided
into two, of which one went to Mary as pin-money,
and the other remained for Percy. But Mary knew
what was meant by “for Percy”: it was for
Godwin despite all vows, for Claire, for the
Hunts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day Captain Roberts was expected over to
luncheon from Genoa. Conscious that their
anchorite way of living would not suit ordinary
mortals, there was considerable commotion at the
villa, but notwithstanding the bother and turmoil
the three women, as is woman’s wont, seemed to
enjoy it. The visitor came and he was most
anxious to see the Poet of whom he had heard so
much, but Shelley had disappeared. They sat
down to table without him. Suddenly one of the
trio of ladies cried out, “Oh my gracious!”
and Mary, turning round, saw Shelley completely
naked crossing the room, and trying to hide behind
the maid-servant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Percy, how dare you!” she cried, which was
imprudent, for Shelley, considering himself unjustly
attacked, abandoned his refuge and came up to the
table to explain. The ladies covered their faces
with their hands. Yet he was good to look at,
his hair full of seaweed, his slender body wet and
scented with the salt of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the daughter of William Godwin had a horror
of such unconventional happenings.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley and Williams waited for their boat with
the impatience of schoolboys, and the moment a
strange sail, coming from the direction of Leghorn,
doubled the point of Lerici, they rushed down to
the beach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Allegra’s death Shelley had written to
Roberts to change the name of his boat from the
<span class='it'>Don Juan</span> to the <span class='it'>Ariel</span>. Everything which
reminded him of Byron was now hateful to him.
Great therefore was his surprise and anger, when
on the arrival of his little yacht, he saw painted
in enormous letters in the middle of the mainsail:
<span class='it'>Don Juan</span>. Byron, told of the change of
name, had forced Roberts, in spite of Shelley’s
orders, to print the sign of the Devil upon the
Platonic bark. Armed with hot water, soap and
brushes, Shelley and Williams set to work to wash
out the infamy from their poor boat. They had
no success. They tried turpentine, which failed
equally. Then they consulted specialists, who were
of opinion that a bit of sail would have to be cut
clean out and a new piece inserted; nothing short
of this could mend the case. Shelley had the
operation performed at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Genoese captain who had sailed the boat
to Lerici, said that she sailed and worked well, but
was a ticklish boat to manage. Shelley and
Williams, enthusiastic but incompetent yachtsmen,
had insisted on having her built to a design made
by a naval officer for Williams, before he left
England. The lovely sweeping lines of the model
enchanted them, but the boat when built to plan
required a couple of tons of iron ballast to bring
her down to her bearings, and even then was very
crank in a breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two owners of the <span class='it'>Ariel</span> determined to man
her themselves, with the help of Charles Vivian,
a young sailor. Shelley was awkward as a woman
in all things appertaining to boats, but full of good
intentions. He tangled himself up in the rigging,
read Sophocles while trying to steer, and several
times just missed falling overboard. But never in
his life had he been so happy. When Trelawny
saw his seamanship, he took Williams by the arm
and advised him to add to the crew a Genoese
accustomed to the coast. Williams was hurt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
three seasoned sailors such as they .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and was
he not Captain? And had he not Shelley?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shelley! You’ll never do any good with him
until you shear the wisps of hair that hang over
his eyes, heave his Greek Poets overboard, and
plunge his arms up to the elbow in a tar-bucket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Ariel</span> drew too much water to be run on
shore at Casa Magni, so Williams with the aid
of a carpenter built a tiny dinghy of basketwork,
covered with tarred canvas. It was a fragile
toy which upset at a touch. The Poet was delighted
with it, although it capsized continually, and gave
him many a ducking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening, as he dragged the skiff out from
the house, he saw Jane and her two children on
the sands. He invited her to bring them for a
row. “With careful stowage,” said he, “there
is room for us all in my barge.” She squatted
in the bottom of the frail skiff with her babies,
and the gunwale sank to within six inches of the
water; a puff of wind, the smallest movement of
any one of them, and it must cant over, fill, and
glide from under them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane understood that Percy intended to float
on the water near the shore, but he, proud to show
a lovely woman how well he sculled, bent to his
oars, and they were soon out on the blue waters
of the bay. Then, shipping the oars, he fell into
a deep reverie. Jane was seized with the most
awful terror. There was no eye watching them,
no boat within a mile, the shore was fast receding, the
water deepening, and the Poet dreaming. She
made several remarks, but they met with no
response.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he raised his head, his face brightened
as with a bright thought, and he exclaimed, joyfully,
“Now let us together solve the great
mystery!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had Jane uttered a cry, her children were lost.
Shelley might made a sudden movement, the bark
would capsize, the waters wrap them round as a
winding-sheet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Suppressing her terror, she
answered promptly, “No, thank you, not now, I
should like my dinner first and so would the
children.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And look, there is Edward coming
on shore with Trelawny .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they’ll be so surprised
at our being out at this time, and Edward
says this boat is not safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Safe!” cried the Poet, “I’d go to Leghorn
or anywhere in her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane felt that the Angel of Death, who always
attended the Poet on the water, now spread his
wings and vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t yet written the words for the
Indian air,” she said carelessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have,” he answered, “but you must
play me the air again, and I’ll try and make the thing
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile he had paddled his cockleshell into
shallow water; as soon as Jane saw the sandy
bottom, she snatched up her babies, and clambered
out so hurriedly that the punt was turned over and
the Poet pinned down underneath it. He rose with
it on his back, like a hermit-crab in any old empty
shell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jane, are you mad?” cried her husband, surprised
at her lubberly way of getting out of a boat.
“Had you waited a moment, we would have hauled
the boat up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you. Oh, I have escaped the most
dreadful fate! Never will I put my foot in that
horrid coffin again. ‘Solve the great mystery!’
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why, he is the greatest of all mysteries!
Who can predict what he will do? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He is seeking
after what we all avoid—death. I wish we were
away. I shall always be in terror.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Poet’s boyish face wore its accustomed
innocent and radiant expression. During this
glorious summer, nothing seemed able to mar his
joy. Of an evening he liked to go sailing in the
<span class='it'>Ariel</span> by moonlight. Mary sitting at his feet, her
head against his knees, remembered how she had
sat thus on the stormy cross-channel journey ten
years ago. Ten years .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what quantities of
things had happened in ten years. How much
subtler, crueller, and more treacherous Life had
been, than either of them had then imagined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting in the stern, Jane sang an Indian
serenade, accompanying it on the guitar, while
Shelley gazed up into the dark blue sky of June,
where the moon burned inextinguishably beautiful,
suffusing the mountain-clouds with intolerable
brilliancy. His mind was emptied of thought, his
senses annihilated in a delicious ecstasy, his soul
clipt in a net woven of dew-beams, seemed to be
floating on waves of love and odour and deep
melody. He walked again among the splendid
visions, the crystalline palaces, the iridescent
vapours, which during so long a time had appeared
to him the sole reality. He knew to-day that there
existed another universe, a harsh and inflexible one
but in these higher regions, only animated by the
liquid and undulating sweetness of song, by the
invisible movement of luminous spheres, in these
regions the jealousy of women, money-worries,
political quarrels, appeared so infinitely petty that
they could hot touch his wild, sweet, incommunicable
happiness. He would have liked to swoon
away in ravishment while saying with Faust to the
passing moment, “Verweile doch! Du bist so
schön.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXXVI<br/> <br/> ARIEL SET FREE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>For a long time, Shelley had wished to bring out
to Italy his friends the Hunts, to whom their
creditors and political enemies gave a hard life in
England. He offered to pay the journey, but he
would not be able, naturally, to support them and
their seven children. He had talked so much
about this to Byron that he had obtained from him
a promise to found with Hunt a liberal newspaper
to be published in Italy, and which would enjoy
copyright of all Byron’s works, a privilege sufficient
in itself to assure the success of the newspaper,
and to make Hunt’s fortune. It was a very
generous offer on Byron’s part, who had nothing
to gain by the association with Hunt, but a good
deal to lose. He did more, however; he would
allow the Hunts to occupy the ground floor of the
Palazzo Lanfranchi, which Shelley on his side
undertook to furnish. Everything being thus
settled, the whole Hunt tribe set out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After incredible difficulties and delays they
arrived at Leghorn by the end of June, 1822.
Trelawny on the <span class='it'>Bolivar</span> was waiting for them in
the harbour. Shelley and Williams arrived on the
<span class='it'>Ariel</span>, scudding into port in fine style. Shelley was
inexpressibly delighted to see Hunt, and set off
with him and the tribe for Pisa. Williams
remained at Leghorn to await the return of his
friend when they would sail home together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately Hunt’s immediate contact with
Byron was far from pleasant. Although Byron
considered Hunt’s political ideas extreme, nevertheless
he had a sort of protective affection for him,
considering him an honest writer, a good father
and husband, a decent sort of fellow. But he had
never been able to endure Hunt’s wife, whom he
considered a dowdy and disagreeable woman as
impertinent as she was silly. Marianne Hunt was
a type of the equalitarian who can never for a
moment forget inequalities. To show that she
was not impressed by Byron’s wealth and position,
she treated him with an insolence that a chimney-sweep
would not have tolerated. With the kind-hearted
and charming Countess Guiccioli she put
on the airs and graces of an outraged British
matron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byron remained courteous, but became glacial.
At the end of twenty-four hours he could endure
no more. Seven disorderly children romped up
and down the Palazzo, spoiling everything. “A
Kraal of Hottentots, dirtier and more mischievous
than Yahoos.” He looked with disgust on such
human vermin, and put his big bull-dog to guard
the staircase: “Don’t let any little cockneys pass
our way!” he told him and patted his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already he was sick of the newspaper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shelley, who should have left the same day,
could not forsake Hunt without having settled the
business. He got round Byron, lectured Marianne,
consoled poor Hunt, and delayed his departure
from day to day until everything was arranged.
His tenacity always triumphed over Byron’s
haughty lassitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He obtained the promise that the first number
of the new paper should have the copyright of <span class='it'>The
Vision of Judgment</span> which Byron had recently
finished. This would give Hunt a first-rate send-off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Williams, waiting at Leghorn, grew impatient
and testy. Never before, he complained, had he
been separated from his wife for so many days.
Shelley sent him letter after letter to explain the
delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The July heat was suffocating; “<span class='it'>le soleil
d’ltalie au rire impitoyable</span>.” The peasants
stopped working in the fields from ten to five.
There was a water shortage, and processions of
priests carried round miraculous statues and
prayed for rain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the morning of the 8th, Trelawny and
Shelley arrived from Pisa. They went to Shelley’s
bank, made purchases for the housekeeping
at Casa Magni, and then the two friends and
Williams went down to the harbour. Trelawny
wanted to accompany the <span class='it'>Ariel</span> on the <span class='it'>Bolivar</span>.
The sky was clouding over, and a light wind blowing
in the direction of Lerici. Captain Roberts
predicted a storm. Williams, who was in a hurry
to be off, declared that in seven hours they would
be at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At midday Shelley, Williams, and Charles
Vivian were on board the <span class='it'>Ariel</span>. Trelawny on the
<span class='it'>Bolivar</span> was getting ready too. The guard-boat
boarded them to overhaul their papers: “La
barchetta <span class='it'>Don Juan</span>? Il capitano Percy Shelley?
Va bene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trelawny, who had not got his port-clearance,
tried to brazen it out. The officer of the Health
Office threatened him with fourteen days’ quarantine.
He proposed to go instantly and obtain the
clearance papers, but Williams, fretting and fuming,
would not hear another word. There was no
more time to be lost. It was two o’clock already,
and there was so little wind they would have great
difficulty in reaching home before night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between two and three o’clock the <span class='it'>Ariel</span> sailed
out of harbour almost at the same moment with
two feluccas. Trelawny re-anchored sullenly,
furled his sails, and with the ship’s glass watched
the progress of their friends. His Genovese mate
said to him, “They should have sailed this morning
at three or four a.m. instead of three p.m.
She is standing too much in-shore; the current will
fix her there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trelawny replied, “She will soon have the
land-breeze.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe she will soon have too much breeze,”
remarked the mate. “That gaff top-sail is
foolish in a boat with no deck and no sailor on
board.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Look at those black lines and the
dirty rags hanging on them out of the sky, look
at the smoke on the water! The Devil is brewing
mischief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing on the end of the mole Captain Roberts
also kept the boat in view. When he could see her
no longer, he got leave to ascend the lighthouse-tower
whence he could again discern her about ten
miles out at sea. A storm was visibly coming
from the Gulf, and he perceived that the <span class='it'>Ariel</span> was
taking in her top-sail. Then the haze of the storm
hid her completely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the harbour it was oppressively sultry. The
heaviness of the atmosphere and an unwonted stillness
benumbed the senses. Trelawny went to his
cabin and fell asleep in spite of himself. He
was aroused by noises overhead: the men were getting
up a chain cable to let go another anchor.
There was a general stir amongst the shipping,
getting-down yards and masts, veering out cables,
letting-go anchors. It was very dark. The sea
looked as solid and smooth as a sheet of lead and
was covered with an oily scum: gusts of wind
swept over it without ruffling it, and big drops of
rain fell on its surface rebounding as if they could
not penetrate it. Fishing-craft under bare poles
rushed by in shoals running foul of the ships in
the harbour. But the din and hubbub made by
men and their shrill pipings were suddenly silenced
by the crashing voice of a thunder-squall that
burst right overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When twenty minutes later the horizon was in
some degree cleared, Trelawny and Roberts looked
anxiously seaward in the hopes of descrying
Shelley’s boat amongst the many small craft
scattered about. No trace of her was to be seen.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other side of the bay two women waited
for news. Mary was uneasy and depressed. The
excessive heat of the summer frightened her. It
was during such a summer that little Willie had
died, and she looked at the baby in her arms with
terror. He seemed certainly in the best of health,
nevertheless, standing on the terrace gazing on one
of the most lovely views in the world, she was
oppressed with wretchedness. Her eyes kept filling
with tears she knew not why. “Yet,”
thought she, “when he, when my Shelley returns,
I shall be happy—he will comfort me; if my boy
be ill, he will restore him and encourage me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the Monday, Jane had a letter from her
husband dated Saturday. He said that Shelley
was still detained at Pisa, “but if he should not
come by Monday, I will come in a felucca, and you
may expect me on Thursday evening at furthest.”
This Monday was the fatal Monday, the day of
the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mary and Jane never imagined for a
moment that the <span class='it'>Ariel</span> could have put to sea in
such weather. On Tuesday it rained all day, and
the sea was calm. On Wednesday the wind was
fair from Leghorn, and several feluccas arrived
thence. The skipper of one of these said that the
<span class='it'>Ariel</span> had sailed on the Monday, but neither Jane
nor Mary believed him. Thursday was another
day of fair wind, and the two women kept continuous
watch from the terrace. Every instant
they hoped to see the tall sails of the little boat
double the promontory. At midnight they were
still watching and still without any sight of the
boat, and they began to fear—not the truth—but
that some illness, some disagreeable occurrence,
had detained their husbands in Leghorn. As the
hours went on, Jane became so miserable that she
determined to hire a boat next day and go to Leghorn
herself. But next day brought with it a
heavy sea and a contrary wind. No boatman
would venture out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At midday came letters. There was one from
Hunt for Shelley. Mary opened it trembling all
over. Hunt said: “Pray write to tell us how you
got home, for they say that you had bad weather
after you sailed on Monday, and we are anxious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letter fell from her hands. Jane picked it
up, read it, and said, “Then it is all over!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my dear Jane, it is not all over, but this
suspense is dreadful! Come with me—we will go
to Leghorn. We will post to be swift and learn
our fate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road from Lerici to Leghorn passes by Pisa.
They stopped at Lord Byron’s house to see if
there was any news. They knocked at the door,
and some one called out “Chi è?” for it was
already late in the evening. It was the Guiccioli’s
maid. Lord Byron was in bed, but the Countess,
all smiles, came down to meet them. On seeing
the terrifying aspect of Mary’s face, very white,
looking like marble, she stopped astonished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is he? Sapete alcuna cosa di
Shelley?” said Mary. Byron who followed his
<span class='it'>dama</span> knew nothing more than that Shelley had
left Pisa the preceding Sunday, and had sailed on
Monday in bad weather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now midnight, but refusing to rest the
two women went on to Leghorn, which they
reached at two o’clock in the morning. Their
coachman took them to the wrong inn where they
found neither Trelawny nor Captain Roberts. They
threw themselves dressed on their beds and waited
for daylight. At six o’clock they visited all the inns
of the town one after the other, and at the <span class='it'>Globe</span>
Roberts came down to them with a face which
told them that the worst was true. They learned
from him all that occurred during that agonizing
week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet hope was not entirely extinct. The <span class='it'>Ariel</span>
might have been blown to Corsica, or Elba, or
even farther. They sent a courier from tower to
tower along the coast as far as Nice to know if
anything had been seen or found, and at 9 a.m.
they quitted Leghorn for Casa Magni. Trelawny
went with them. At Via Reggio they were told
that a punt, a water-keg, and some bottles had
been cast up on the beach. Trelawny went to
look at them and recognized the little skiff of the
<span class='it'>Ariel</span>. But there was the possibility that, finding
it cumbersome in bad weather, they had thrown
it overboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Jane and Mary reached home, the village
was holding high festival. The noise of dancing,
laughing and singing kept them awake the whole
night through.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Five or six days later Trelawny, who had promised
a reward to any of the coastguard who
should send him news, was called to Via Reggio
where a body had been washed up by the sea. It
was a corpse terrible to look upon, for the face
and hands and those parts of the body not protected
by the clothes had been eaten away by the
fish. But the tall slight figure, the jacket, the
volume of Sophocles in one pocket and Keats’
poems in the other, doubled back as if the reader,
in the act of reading, had hastily thrust it away,
were all too familiar to Trelawny to leave a doubt
on his mind that this mutilated body was any other
than Shelley’s. Almost at the same time the
corpse of Williams was found not far off, more
mutilated still, and three weeks later a third body
was found, that of Charles Vivian, the sailor boy,
about four miles from the other two. It was a
mere skeleton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trelawny had the remains buried temporarily in
the sand to preserve them from the sea, and
galloped off towards Casa Magni.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the threshold of the house he stopped. There
was no one to be seen .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a lamp burned in the
big room .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps the two widows were
suggesting to one another new grounds for hope.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Trelawny thought of his last visit there.
Then the two families had all been on the terrace
overhanging a sea so calm and clear that every
star was reflected in the waters. Williams had
cried “Buona notte!” and Trelawny had rowed
himself on board the <span class='it'>Bolivar</span> at anchor in the bay.
From afar he had listened to Jane singing some
merry tune to the accompaniment of her guitar.
Shelley’s shrill laugh had pierced the quiet night,
and Trelawny had looked back with regret on a
set of human beings who had seemed to him the
happiest and most united in the whole world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His reverie was broken by a shriek from the
nurse Caterina, as crossing the hall she saw him
in the doorway. He went upstairs and unannounced
entered the room where Mary and Jane
sat waiting. He could not speak a word. Mary
Shelley’s hazel eyes fixed themselves on his with
a terrible intensity. She cried out: “Is there no
hope?” Trelawny, without answering, left the
room, and told the servant to take the children to
the two poor mothers.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXXVII<br/> <br/> LAST LINKS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Mary wished to have Shelley buried near their
little boy in the Roman cemetery which he had
thought so beautiful, but the sanitary laws forbade
that bodies once buried in quicklime on the sands,
should be transferred elsewhere. Trelawny suggested,
therefore, that the remains should be
burned on the shore, according to the custom of
the ancient Greeks. When the day was fixed for
this ceremony, he sent word to Byron and Hunt,
who wished to be present, and came himself on the
<span class='it'>Bolivar</span>. The Tuscan authorities had provided a
squad of soldiers armed with mattocks and spades.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remains of Williams were dug out first.
Standing round on the loose sand that scorched
their feet his friends watched the soldiers at
work and waited with curiosity and horror the
first appearance of the body. A black silk handkerchief
was pulled out, then some shreds of linen,
a boot with the bone of the leg and the foot in it,
then a shapeless mass of bones and flesh. The
limbs separated from the trunk on being touched.
The soldiers performed their work with long-handled
tongs, nippers, poles, with iron hooks,
spikes, and divers other tools all resembling
implements of torture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that a human body?” exclaimed Byron.
“Why, it’s more like the carcase of a sheep!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was greatly moved, and tried to hide his
emotion, which he thought maudlin and unmanly,
under an air of indifference. When they were
lifting the skull, “Stop a moment, let me see the
jaw,” he said. “I can recognize by the teeth
anyone with whom I have talked. I always watch
the mouth, it tells me what the eyes try to conceal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A funeral pyre had been prepared, Trelawny
applied the fire, and the materials being dry and
resinous the pine-wood flamed furiously, and the
heat drove the spectators back. The body and
skull, burning fiercely, gave the flames a silvery
and wavy look of indescribable brightness and
purity. When the heat was a little diminished
Byron and Hunt threw on to the fire frankincense,
salt and wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” said Byron suddenly, “let us try the
strength of these waters that drowned our
friends.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How far out do you think they were
when their boat sunk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps mingled with his grief was the thought
that he, who had swum the Hellespont, would not
have let himself be drowned in this less dangerous
sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stripped, went into the water, and swam
out. Trelawny and Hunt followed him. When
they turned to look back at the pyre it seemed a
mere little glittering patch upon the sand.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ceremony was repeated next day for
Shelley, who had been buried in the sand, nearer
to Via Reggio, between the sea and a pine-wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weather was glorious. In the strong sunlight,
the yellow sands and the deep violet sea made
a wonderful contrast. Above the trees, the snow-capped
Appenines paved the sky with a cloudy
and marmoreal background such as Shelley would
have loved. All the children of the country-side
were gathered round to witness so unusual a spectacle,
but not a word was spoken among them.
Byron himself was silent and thoughtful. “Ah,
Will of iron! This then is all that remains of
your splendid courage.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Like Prometheus
you defied Jupiter, and behold .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soldiers dug for nearly an hour without
finding the exact place. Suddenly a dull hollow
sound following the blow of a mattock warned
them that the iron had struck a skull. Byron
shuddered. He thought of Shelley during the
storm on Lake Leman, whose crossed arms,
heroic yet impotent, had seemed to him at the time
an accurate symbol of his life. “How brutally
mistaken men have been about him! He was
without exception the <span class='it'>best</span> and least selfish man I
ever knew. And as perfect a gentleman as ever
crossed a drawing-room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The body had been covered with lime, which
had almost completely carbonized it. Once more
incense, oil and salt were thrown upon the flames,
and more wine was poured over Shelley’s dead
body than he had ever consumed during life. The
intense heat made the atmosphere tremulous and
wavy. At the end of three hours the heart, which
was unusually big, remained unconsumed. Trelawny
snatched it from the fiery furnace, burning
his hand severely in doing so. The frontal bone
of the skull where it had been struck by the mattock
fell off, and the brains literally seethed,
bubbled and boiled as in a cauldron for a very
long time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Byron could not face this scene. As on the previous
day he stripped and swam to the <span class='it'>Bolivar</span>,
which was anchored in the bay. Trelawny
gathered together the fragments of bone and
human ashes, and placed them in an oaken casket
lined with black velvet, which he had brought with
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The village children, looking on with all their
eyes, told each other that from these bones, once
they reached England, the dead man would come
to life.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:x-large;'>⁂</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now to tell what became of the other actors in
this story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Timothy Shelley lived to the age of ninety-one,
dying in 1844. He made Mary a small
allowance, but she had to promise not to publish
her husband’s posthumous poems, nor any biography
of him so long as the old baronet lived.
At his death, Percy Florence came into the title
and the fortune, Harriet’s son Charles having died
in his eleventh year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A common misfortune had united the two
widows, Mary and Jane. For a long time they
lived together in Italy, and afterwards in London.
Shelley’s friends were so faithful to them that
Trelawny asked the hand of Mary in marriage,
and a little later Hogg, the sceptic, asked the
hand of Jane. Mary refused, saying that she
thought Mary Shelley so pretty a name she
wished to have it on her tombstone. Jane
accepted, but then had to confess she had never
been married to Williams. She still had a husband
somewhere in India. This did not trouble Hogg,
and freed them both from any ceremony. They
never left each other, and lived under decorous
appearances. Although Hogg was accurate and a
hard worker, he was considered mediocre at the
Bar, where he pleaded without warmth or
eloquence. Towards the end of his life he became
a timorous, disillusioned old gentleman, reading
Greek and Latin all day long to kill time and cheat
his immense boredom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Claire remained on the Continent, was a
governess in Russia, and at the death of Sir
Timothy inherited the twelve thousand pounds left
her by Shelley, and was freed from poverty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The older they grew the more these three
women quarrelled amongst themselves. Jane
declared to everyone that during the last months
at Casa Magni Shelley had loved her alone.
These assertions repeated to Mary exasperated her
so much that she refused to see Jane again.
Little by little Miranda became an old woman, a
trifle deaf, but always charming. Her eyes would
still sparkle when she spoke of the Poet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During many years Claire occupied herself in
writing a book in which she intended to point out,
by the examples of Shelley, Byron and herself,
how necessary it is to have only conventional ideas
on the question of love. But, having had a mental
illness, she was obliged to give up work during
a long period. She passed the end of her life in
Florence, where she became a Roman Catholic and
occupied herself in charities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day in the spring of 1878 a young man
searching for documents on Byron and Shelley
came to ask her for reminiscences of them. When
he pronounced these two names, there appeared
beneath the old lady’s wrinkles one of those smiles,
girlish yet full of promises, which had made her
so fascinating at eighteen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” she said, “I suppose you are as crass
as most men, and think that I loved Byron?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as he looked at her with surprise:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My young friend,” said she, “no doubt you
will know a woman’s heart better some day. I
was dazzled, but that does not mean love. It
might perhaps have grown into love, but it never
did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a silence. The visitor, hesitating a
little, asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you never loved, Madame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A delicate blush suffused the withered cheeks,
and this time she made no reply, gazing on the
ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shelley?” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With all my heart and soul,” she replied,
without raising her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then with a charming coquetry she gave him a
tap on the cheek with her closed fan.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&trade; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&trade; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
